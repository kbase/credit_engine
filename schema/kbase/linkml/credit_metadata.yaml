  CreditMetadata:
    description: |
      Represents the credit metadata associated with a workspace object.

      In the following documentation, 'Resource' is used to refer to the workspace object
      that the CM pertains to.

      The 'resource_type' field should be filled using values from the DataCite
      resourceTypeGeneral field:

      https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-mandatory-properties#10a-resourcetypegeneral

      Currently the KBase workspace only supports credit metadata for objects of type
      'dataset'; anything else will return an error.

      The license may be supplied either as an URL pointing to licensing information for
      the resource, or using a license name. See https://choosealicense.com/appendix/ for
      a list of common open source licenses.

      Required fields are:
      - identifier
      - versioning information: if the resource does not have an explicit version number,
      one or more dates should be supplied: ideally the date of resource publication and
      the last update (if applicable).
      - contributors (one or more required)
      - titles (one or more required)

      The resource_type field is required, but as there is currently only a single valid
      value, 'dataset', it is automatically populated if no value is supplied.

  Contributor:

      Represents a contributor to the resource.

      Contributors must have a 'contributor_type', either 'Person' or 'Organization', and
      a 'name'.

      The 'credit_name' field is used to store the name of a person as it would appear in
      a citation. If there is no 'credit_name' supplied, the 'name' field would be used
      in citations.
      For example:
        name:         Hubert George Wells
        credit_name:  Wells, HG

        name:         Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
