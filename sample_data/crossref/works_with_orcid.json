Despite the use of intensive chemotherapy treatments most patients succumb to the disease, highlighting the critical need to develop better and safer therapies. Due to the rarity of ENKTL, less is known about the biology of disease including the cause, the cells that give rise to the cancer, and the key cellular events and processes that cause the tumor cells to survive and grow uncontrollably.\n\nIn our preliminary studies, we have identified the likely source of normal cells that give rise to ENKTL tumor cells, allowing us to make detailed comparisons of the biology of the tumor cells. Cells develop normally from immature precursor cells, and we have importantly found that ENKTL cells are locked into specific stages of immature cell development. We have discovered that ENKTL cells exhibit a DNA abnormality called hypermethylation that is likely responsible for the developmental blockage. We believe that this DNA abnormality could represent the cancer\u2019s \u201cAchilles\u2019 heel\u201d and can be targeted with current FDA approved drugs termed hypomethylating agents that are known to affect this defect. We next developed a novel way to model ENKTL in mice using patient-derived tumor cells. Using this model, we have discovered that use of hypomethylating agents is highly effective in eliminating tumor cells, leading to a cure in some mice. However some resistance to the therapy is observed. \n\nPartnering with a large international collaborative group including researchers from ENKTL endemic regions Peru, Guatemala and Taiwan, as well as several institutions here in the United States, my laboratory will determine how prevalent this DNA abnormality is across a range of patient populations and if DNA hypermethylation is a promising target for treatment. We will also look for potential other features of tumor cells that contribute to or synergize with hypermethylation, and if the degree of hypermethylation and development blockage is a useful biomarker that could be used in disease prognosis. We have also uncovered a potential cause of hypermethylation that relates to novel biology surrounding viral infection of tumor cells. We will test the role of this potential mechanism in normal and tumor cells. Using our novel disease models, we will investigate how hypomethylating agents kill cancer cells and how surviving cells evade the therapy. We also will use our systems to devise improved ways to build on hypomethylating agents to more effectively kill cells and circumvent resistance.\n\nAt the completion of this project we will have gained a better understanding of the origins, causes and utility of the underlying fundamental features of ENKTL. We hope to provide a foundation for a new therapy for patients in need of a better and safer treatment for this devastating disease.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Yiping","family":"Yang","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kevin","family":"Taylor","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Bob","family":"Scher","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00rs6vg23","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The

the potential of preemptive intervention in subclinical disease to improve clinical outcomes. This is\nparticularly valuable in Neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1-associated optic pathway gliomas (OPGs), where the traditional endpoint of progression-free survival does not correlate\nwith the functional outcome of vision. We will interrogate two promising advanced magnetic resonance techniques, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF), that investigate tissue microstructure as potential biomarkers in OPG. Using DTI, we will define age based normal values of white matter integrity of the developing optic pathway in DTI SA1. A prospective, multi-institutional investigation of 68 children with OPG will determine the association between white matter damage and current and future visual acuity in DTI SA2. In DTI SA3, DTI will be combined with optical coherence tomography of the anterior visual pathway to determine whether a more complete assessment of visual pathway damage will better predict visual acuity in OPG. Using MRF, we will define the multiparametric signature of OPG that distinguishes it from normal tissue (MRF SA1) and spongiotic change (MRF SA2). We will determine whether MRF better correlates with white matter integrity in the optic radiations to determine whether MRF can identify occult tumor infiltration (MRF SA3). The proposed research intends to describe and validate non-invasive imaging biomarkers in OPGs in order to improve clinical outcomes by early identification of visual acuity loss, risk stratification of future vision loss and development of quantifiable and reliable outcome markers.","language":"en"}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6623-3040","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Peter","family":"de Blank","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/01hcyya48","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Children's Hospital Medical Center"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":232575.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,1]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"JHU-NTAP \u2013 Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100014804","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,11]],"date-time":"2021-11-11T19:41:22Z","timestamp":1636659682000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.147651"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.54464\/pc.gr.147651"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,2]],"date-time":"2022-04-02T17:50:47Z","timestamp":1648921847187},"publisher":"American Cancer Society","award":"PF-21-094-01-HOPS","DOI":"10.53354\/pc.gr.151085","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]],"date-time":"2021-10-29T14:05:59Z","timestamp":1635516359000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.53354","member":"1849","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Harnessing Geospatial Data for Precision Prevention of Prostate Cancer","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"In 2021, an estimated 248,530 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States of America, and 34,130 men will die from the disease. African American men experience over twice the prostate cancer mortality of White men, a disparity that has persisted for as long as reliable data have been available. While prostate-specific antigen screening allows earlier diagnosis, routine screening has been discouraged by major American public health bodies due to concerns about overtreatment. Since 2012, screening rates have plummeted, declines in prostate cancer mortality rates have stalled, and the proportion of cases presenting with metastatic disease is rising. Refined risk stratification approaches could prevent prostate cancer mortality and reduce racial disparities. Precision prevention refers to the incorporation of cross-disciplinary knowledge and multilevel data to improve targeting of early detection and prevention strategies for cancer. Precision prevention would help identify both people at risk of prostate cancer mortality, as well as places where communities at elevated risk are located. In this proposal, we seek to pilot one of the first geospatial precision prevention efforts to identify people and places at elevated prostate cancer mortality risk and model strategies to increase screening in vulnerable populations. Data will be obtained from nine population-based cancer registry cohorts with 719,299 eligible men with prostate cancer and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). We will link publicly available area-level neighborhood socioeconomic, environmental, and health care access data to residential addresses that have been randomly perturbed to protect patient privacy. In Aim 1, we will discover and validate replicable neighborhood predictors of mortality among men with prostate cancer using training and test data across the three registry cohorts. In Aim 2, we will characterize barriers to PSA testing for men in different sociodemographic groups, comparing the relative strength of travel time, physician density, insurance, and comfortable health care utilization with receipt of PSA testing. In Aim 3, we will estimate the effect of spatially-determined interventions to reduce barriers to PSA screening. Results will reveal where different types of barriers would, if removed, yield reductions in prostate cancer mortality. The research plan described in this proposal is complemented by a training plan that will provide me with applied knowledge in oncology health services research and technical training in data science that I will need to pursue a career as an independent scientist. My advisory panel, institutional support, and the rich academic environment at the Dana-Farber Harvard Cancer Center will help me progress towards my long-term goal of becoming an independent scientist.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Tina","family":"Da Silva","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02jzgtq86","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}]},{"given":"Leslie","family":"Colon","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02jzgtq86","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}]},{"given":"Luna","family":"Latif","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Timothy","family":"Rebbeck","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02jzgtq86","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}]},{"given":"Deborah","family":"Schrag","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02jzgtq86","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}]},{"given":"Leah","family":"Gibbons","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02jzgtq86","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}]},{"given":"Zoe","family":"Zoufaly","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02jzgtq86","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7596-9049","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hari","family":"Iyer","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02jzgtq86","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":175500.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]],"date-time":"2021-10-29T14:06:03Z","timestamp":1635516363000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.151085"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.151085"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,2]],"date-time":"2022-04-02T14:32:25Z","timestamp":1648909945040},"publisher":"Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC)","award":"XN003","DOI":"10.47486\/xn003","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,20]],"date-time":"2020-10-20T04:43:21Z","timestamp":1603169001000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.47486","member":"26267","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Biomedical Data Asset","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"This project will link two of Australia\u2019s most important biomedical datasets in a highly curated, user-friendly and accessible environment.\n                    Mice and humans share a similar set of genes and as a result their biology has played a critical role in medical advancements in recent years.

The efficacy and toxicity of drugs are often related to their blood or plasma concentration, which cannot be easily predicted from the dose because of high interpatient variability. Although blood analysis of drug concentrations can be performed at health care facilities, there is increasing interest in less invasive and more convenient methods that allow real-time and continuous quantitation. Towards President Obama's statement in announcing the Precision Medicine Initiative \"What if figuring out the right dose of medicine was as simple as taking our temperature?\", here we seek to develop fully integrated wearable or portable graphene-based sensor prototypes to reliably quantitate drug levels in saliva and sweat to enable real-time monitoring of two cancer drugs - busulfan (BU) and cyclophosphamide (CY) in patients. Plasma drug concentration-time curves (AUC) is a predictive biomarker that forecasts the likely response to BU or CY-containing conditioning regimens administered prior to hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Personalizing BU and CY doses is clinically accepted for the majority of BU- and CY-conditioned patients. Furthermore, the increasing use of shorter intravenous (IV) BU and CY courses necessitates alternative methods to personalize BU and CY doses because of the time delay with conventional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) quantitation. We designed the following complementary aims to test our hypothesis that the secretion of BU and CY in sweat and saliva is mainly based on passive diffusion from plasma; saliva and sweat BU and CY AUCs monitored via wearable\/portable sensor could enable real-time dose personalization. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop wearable\/portable prototypes for real-time quantitation of BU and CY concentrations in three matrices: plasma, saliva, and sweat. We have developed graphene sensors that can quantitate pharmacologically relevant BU and CY levels in biofluids. We will refine the graphene-based sensors for highly sensitive and selective drug quantitation and develop the technology for sensor regeneration. The sensor accuracy will be evaluated in biofluids obtained from 20 cancer patients receiving BU or CY drugs, and validated by LC-MS. In Specific Aim 2, we will develop the integrated wearable\/portable system for continuous BU and CY monitoring. We will conduct a pilot study of the continuous and real-time BU monitoring to evaluate and validate the wearable\/portable prototypes in 30 cancer patients. The correlation between sweat\/saliva and serum drug levels will be investigated. Developing such prototypes will enable acquiring basic biomedical knowledge about BU and CY secretion through sweat and salivary glands, BU and CY pharmacodynamics (what BU and CY do to the patient\u2019s body), BU and CY pharmacokinetics (what the body does to BU and CY) and precision medicine.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Lisa","family":"Miller","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05dxps055","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"California Institute of Technology"}]},{"given":"Guruswami","family":"Ravichandran","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Fred","family":"Farina","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rochelle","family":"Athey","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05dxps055","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"California Institute of Technology"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0795-497X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jeannine","family":"McCune","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00w6g5w60","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope"}]},{"given":"RYOTARO","family":"NAKAMURA","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00w6g5w60","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8503-4562","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Wei","family":"Gao","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05dxps055","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"California Institute of Technology"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":792000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2025,12,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]],"date-time":"2022-01-10T19:47:59Z","timestamp":1641844079000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.152684"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.152684"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,29]],"date-time":"2022-03-29T05:56:37Z","timestamp":1648533397200},"publisher":"Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI)","award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,20]]},"award":"508743","DOI":"10.46936\/10.25585\/60008480","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,8]],"date-time":"2022-03-08T17:20:06Z","timestamp":1646760006000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.46936","member":"960","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Microbial Community Drivers of Persistent, Divergent Patterns of Carbon Flow Under Field Conditions"}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7642-4633","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Marie","family":"Kroeger","affiliation":[{"name":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","country":"US"}]}],"co-lead-investigator":[{"given":"John","family":"Dunbar","affiliation":[{"name":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","country":"US"}]}],"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"US Department of Energy","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000015","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,8]],"date-time":"2022-03-08T17:20:07Z","timestamp":1646760007000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.osti.gov\/award-doi-service\/biblio\/10.46936\/10.25585\/60008480"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,20]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.46936\/10.25585\/60008480"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,29]],"date-time":"2022-03-29T04:45:27Z","timestamp":1648529127346},"publisher":"Children's Tumor Foundation","award":"CTF-2019-05-005","DOI":"10.48105\/pc.gr.90471","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,22]],"date-time":"2021-01-22T19:18:36Z","timestamp":1611343116000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.48105","member":"28169","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Evaluation of the use of antisense oligonucleotides as a personalized therapy for Neurofibromatosis Type 2 patients","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"One of the therapeutic approaches that are being successfully developed for several inherited diseases are therapies that act at RNA level. Currently, it is possible to design antisense oligonucleotides that correct or change the expression of NF2 and modify it to less harmful\/deleterious forms. There are already many examples of the use of these molecules, some in advanced stages in clinical trials. In the case of NF2, our group made a first approach when investigating the use of this type of molecules in a patient with an intronic mutation that was altering the correct splicing of NF2. Our study allowed the correction of this mutation in patient cells (in vitro) with very satisfactory results, demonstrating the potential use of these molecules as a therapy to repair splicing defects in patients with NF2. Besides correcting the aberrant splicing of the NF2 gene, these molecules could also be used to force the omission of those exons that carry truncated mutations whenever a semi-functional protein is produced. Thus, taking into account the genotype-phenotype association, mutations that generate a more serious phenotype could be modified to less harmful ones. Overall, approximately 45% of the mutations detected in the NF2 gene could be potentially treated with antisense therapy. In this project we propose to evaluate the use of antisense oligonucleotides to reduce the severity of truncated mutations in NF2 by inducing a milder phenotype in primary fibroblasts derived from patients with NF2. The results of this study will allow the identification of possible candidates for future studies in experimental animals (in vivo). This work will allow the evaluation of the use of antisense oligonucleotides as an experimental therapy in cells of patients with NF2. The demonstration that the use of these molecules could reduce the severity of some mutations in NF2 (truncating and splicing mutations), could open the possibility of further studies in experimental animals with in vivo models, which would allow an important step towards an effective therapy for patients with NF2.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Carles","family":"Esquerre","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03bzdww12","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Fundaci\u00f3

causally associated with more than 200,000 human cancers annually, including lymphoid malignancies such as Burkitt\u2019s Lymphoma (BL), Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (HL) and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) of the immune suppressed. Importantly, de novo EBV infection of primary human B cells leads to their immortalization as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), which serve as a model for EBV+ DLBCL. Despite this potency as a growth transformant, prior studies have shown that EBV can also restrict proliferation, yielding only a small fraction of initially infected cells that sustain viral persistence and long-term outgrowth. Although EBV pathogenesis has been studied extensively, the factors that determine in early-stage infection whether a given EBV+ B cell arrests or proliferates remain unknown. Because EBV induces these heterogeneous cell fates, single-cell experimental methods and analyses are essential to address this gap in knowledge. We have recently used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to reveal substantial and unexpected virus-driven transcriptomic heterogeneity that suggests differential fitness among individual LCL cells. In addition, we have worked with collaborators to develop a microfluidic platform to continuously culture individual human B cells in a highly parallel fashion and quantify single-clone growth dynamics and biomarker expression. These tools and techniques provide avenues to study cell-to-cell differences in growth, gene expression, and regulation and their respective consequences for cell fate during the early stages of EBV infection at unprecedented scale and resolution. The goal of this study is to use these single-cell techniques to quantify the timing, frequencies, and cell fate consequences of distinct EBV-host interactions and to identify patterns of genome-wide regulated expression in cells that exhibit growth restriction. Completion of the proposed work will resolve the nature and outcomes of heterogeneous EBV-host dynamics during early infection and, in so doing, develop a clearer understanding of EBV-driven lymphomagenesis.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Jennifer","family":"McCallister","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03njmea73","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Duke University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Micah","family":"Luftig","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03njmea73","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Duke University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Tonya","family":"Peace","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00py81415","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Duke University"}]},{"given":"Gail","family":"Bullock","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00py81415","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Duke University"}]},{"given":"Joseph","family":"Heitman","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03njmea73","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Duke University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Christine","family":"Krupa","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03njmea73","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Duke University School of Medicine"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3362-1028","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Elliott","family":"SoRelle","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03njmea73","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Duke University School of Medicine"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":119500.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2023,12,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]],"date-time":"2021-10-29T14:06:03Z","timestamp":1635516363000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.151086"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.151086"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,2]],"date-time":"2022-04-02T09:18:04Z","timestamp":1648891084891},"publisher":"American Cancer Society","award":"MBGI-21-180-01-MBG","DOI":"10.53354\/pc.gr.152683","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,1]],"date-time":"2022-04-01T19:45:23Z","timestamp":1648842323000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.53354","member":"1849","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Precision targeting of the labile iron pool for cancer theranostics","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Cancer cells are known to require extraordinarily high amounts of iron compared to normal cells in order to grow indefinitely.  We and others have exploited this phenomenon to develop therapies that target iron to release potent drugs within cancer cells while sparing normal cells.   Our data in animal cancer models show that very aggressive tumors can be effectively treated using this approach and the side effects are minimal.  To understand if this therapeutic strategy can be used to treat cancer patients, we need to directly measure iron levels within human tumors, which is not currently possible.  To address this unmet need, we recently developed the first imaging technology capable of measuring iron concentrations directly and safely in living subjects.  The technology involves injecting a subject with a chemical sensor (termed 18F-TRX) that accumulates in tumors in an iron-dependent fashion.  Tumor levels of 18F-TRX are then measured with a standard PET scan, and these data report out a quantification of iron levels.  We can subsequently use these measurements to predict whether an iron targeted therapy would be an effective treatment for a given tumor.  Having shown that 18F-TRX can measure iron in animal models of human cancer, the goal of this Mission Boost project is to conduct the necessary experiments to gain FDA approval to apply 18F-TRX to cancer patients.  These experiments will provide an avenue to the secondary Boost, during which we will acquire PET images with 18F-TRX in cancer patients for the first time.  With these data, we will be able to definitively conclude whether, as hypothesized based on animal data, iron levels are sufficiently high to be exploited for tumor specific delivery of anticancer therapies.  Moreover, virtually all tumor types require substantial iron to survive; therefore, iron targeted PET imaging itself could have important clinical applications as a novel approach to detect tumors that are currently occult on standard of care glucose targeted PET imaging.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Annie","family":"Gregory","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/043mz5j54","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Regents of the University of California, San Francisco (Contracts & Grants)"}]},{"given":"Talmadge","family":"King","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/043mz5j54","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Regents of the University of California, San Francisco (Contracts & Grants)"}]},{"given":"Christopher","family":"Hess","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/043mz5j54","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"CA - 29\/248 - University of California at San Francisco"}]},{"given":"Anthony","family":"Francis","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ellyn","family":"McCaffrey","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/043mz5j54","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of California, San Francisco"}]},{"given":"Rahul","family":"Aggarwal","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/043mz5j54","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Regents of the University of California, San Francisco (Contracts & Grants)"}]},{"given":"Janay","family":"Hansen","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/043mz5j54","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of California, San Francisco"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4947-1316","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Michael","family":"Evans","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/043mz5j54","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Regents of the University of California, San Francisco (Contracts & Grants)"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":240000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2023,12,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,1]],"date-time":"2022-04-01T19:45:25Z","timestamp":1648842325000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.152683"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.152683"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,2]],"date-time":"2022-04-02T06:27:52Z","timestamp":1648880872158},"publisher":"Wellcome","award":"081454","DOI":"10.35802\/081454","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,17]],"date-time":"2020-12-17T18:59:26Z","timestamp":1608231566000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.35802","member":"13928","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Constructing the patient consumer: patient groups and health consumerism, 1960-1991."}],"investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9674-9953","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alex","family":"Mold","affiliation":[{"name":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine","country":"GB"}]}],"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2007,7,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"grant","scheme":"Medical Humanities","funder":{"name":"Wellcome Trust","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100004440","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,17]],"date-time":"2020-12-17T19:34:44Z","timestamp":1608233684000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/grantfinder\/grantdetails?query=pi:\"Mold+A\"+gid:\"081454\"+ga:\"Wellcome Trust\""}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,7,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.35802\/081454"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,3]],"date-time":"2022-04-03T15:59:37Z","timestamp":1649001577336},"publisher":"Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC)","award":"PL110","DOI":"10.47486\/pl110","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,23]],"date-time":"2020-10-23T03:15:03Z","timestamp":1603422903000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.47486","member":"26267","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"FAIMS 3.0 Electronic Field Notebooks","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Transforming field research by overcoming the \u2018digitisation bottleneck\u2019, and reducing the cost of creating digital and FAIR-compliant data.

Our proposed study is aiming at elucidating a novel tumor suppressive function of the Hippo pathway in regulating DNA damage repair, whose deregulation has been frequently observed in tumorigenesis. To achieve this, we will focus on a transcription factor named MTF1, because our preliminary data have revealed MTF1 as a new downstream effector for the Hippo pathway and also a potential regulator of the DNA damage repair proteins. Specifically, we will study the DNA damage response pathways in the Hippo pathway-deficient cells and elucidate the roles of the Hippo-MTF1 axis in DNA damage repair and its-associated chemotherapy.

However, Prof. Allison and Honjo demonstrated that advanced melanoma can be sensitive to immunotherapy, which removes the brakes that prohibit our immune system to fight tumors and which earned them the Nobel prize in 2018. The most successful immunotherapy strategy relies on the blockade of a molecule called PD-1, yet only ~30% of melanoma patients respond, while the others experience tumor growth. It is imperative to understand why PD-1 immunotherapy fails, in order to counteract the mechanisms involved and extend the therapeutic benefits to as many melanoma patients as possible. Here we hypothesize that one of the possible reasons of PD-1 immunotherapy failure is that PD-1 blockade not only improves the function of the cells that fight cancer, but also the function of the cells that normally prevent excessive immune responses but in the case of tumors prohibit a full-fledged immune attack to the cancer. Here we propose to study the mechanisms by which PD-1 blockade improves the function of immunosuppressive T regulatory cells. We posit that PD-1 immunotherapy directly increases the responsiveness of Treg to stimulation, and that it also instructs other T cell types to produce factors increasing Treg survival. We hypothesize that the latter mechanism gives the highest contribution. Another important question we will ask is whether we can improve the effectiveness of PD-1 immunotherapy against melanoma by concomitantly blocking the unwanted effects on T regulatory cells. The results of our studies will be important because they will elucidate the effects of PD-1 blockade on T regulatory cells and will establish concepts that can be exploited to optimize clinical immunotherapy and extend its benefits to otherwise resistant patients.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Rocquael","family":"Gaines","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/04gyf1771","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of California, Irvine"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4944-9274","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anand","family":"Ganesan","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/04gyf1771","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Regents of the University of California (Irvine)"}]},{"given":"Marc","family":"Mullendore","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/04gyf1771","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Regents of the University of California (Irvine)"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2490-849X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Francesco","family":"Marangoni","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/04gyf1771","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Regents of the University of California (Irvine)"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":255000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2025,5,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"Melanoma Research Alliance","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100005190","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]],"date-time":"2022-04-06T19:38:20Z","timestamp":1649273900000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.154403"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.48050\/pc.gr.154403"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,7]],"date-time":"2022-04-07T15:15:05Z","timestamp":1649344505554},"publisher":"Melanoma Research Alliance","award":"923516","DOI":"10.48050\/pc.gr.154401","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]],"date-time":"2022-04-06T19:51:20Z","timestamp":1649274680000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.48050","member":"28092","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Targeting oncogenic Gaq in uveal melanoma","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Uveal melanoma (UM) is a devastating cancer with a 10-year mortality of 50%. Despite dramatic success in therapies for other melanomas, most approaches have been ineffective for UM. Our team discovered that UM is different from other melanomas because it is caused by mutations in the Gq cellular communication pathway. The Gq pathway is important for many functions in the body, and is turned on and off repeatedly during normal physiology. In UM, mutations in two molecular switches in this pathway, Gaq and Ga11, cause these proteins to be trapped in the \u2018on\u2019 position. UM cancer cells grow unchecked because these switches can\u2019t be turned off. The simplest way to target UM would be to directly shut off these two switches. This has been challenging because all known approaches also target the normal Gq pathway function important, which leads to toxic side effects. We are approaching this problem in a fundamentally new way. For decades, the field has assumed that the cancer causing, mutated forms of Gaq and Ga11 are identical to the normal versions of these proteins trapped in the \u2018on\u2019 state. But recent studies, and some of our preliminary work, suggest that there are important differences in the three-dimensional shape of the cancer-causing mutant proteins and the normal protein. Additionally, the cellular communication output of the cancer causing Gaq and Ga11 proteins is distinct from how the normal version of these proteins communicate. Understanding these nuances creates an unprecedented opportunity to selectively target the cancer-causing Gaq and Ga11 proteins without disturbing the function of the normal protein in the rest of the body. Our proposal will combine cutting edge approaches in understanding how these proteins work and how they talk to other proteins in the cell. We will use these to engineer molecules that are selective for the cancer-causing Gaq and Ga11 proteins, setting the foundation for discovery of new therapies for UM.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Wayland","family":"Gee","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/043mz5j54","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Regents of the University of California, San Francisco (Contracts & Grants)"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7173-3741","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Aashish","family":"Manglik","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/043mz5j54","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of California, San Francisco"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9366-6770","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Michelle","family":"Arkin","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/043mz5j54","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of California, San Francisco"}]},{"given":"Ruth","family":"Huettenhain","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2524-4979","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"xu","family":"chen","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/043mz5j54","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"CA - 29\/29 - The Regents of the University of California, San Francisco"}]},{"given":"Kimberly","family":"Gonzales","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/043mz5j54","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Regents of the University of California, San Francisco (Contracts & Grants)"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1836-6062","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Boris","family":"Bastian","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/043mz5j54","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Regents of the University of California, San Francisco (Contracts & Grants)"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":900000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2025,5,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"Melanoma Research Alliance","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100005190","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]],"date-time":"2022-04-06T19:51:20Z","timestamp":1649274680000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.154401"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.48050\/pc.gr.154401"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,7]],"date-time":"2022-04-07T15:15:10Z","timestamp":1649344510483},"publisher":"Melanoma Research Alliance","award":"928137","DOI":"10.48050\/pc.gr.154396","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]],"date-time":"2022-04-06T19:23:45Z","timestamp":1649273025000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.48050","member":"28092","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Analytical and clinical validation of a multiplex IF biomarker for anti-PD1","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Across tumor types, PD-L1 membranous (cell surface) expression in pre-treatment biopsies is the most commonly used correlate of the likelihood of response to anti-PD-1 therapy. However, the PD-L1 IHC test did not correlate with long-term survival in patients with melanoma, and is no longer a FDA approved complementary diagnostic. There are other related features in the tumor microenvironment which have been shown to improve on the PD-L1 biomarker, including CD8+FoxP3+ cell density, and CD163 and Sox10\/S100 immunostains, the latter of which help identify co-expression of PD-L1 on specific immune cell subsets and tumor cells, respectively. We developed a quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence assay, which captures these features and includes PD-L1, PD-1, CD8, FoxP3, CD68, a tumor marker, a pan-membrane marker and DAPI. Through this assay, it is possible to enumerate key cellular subsets and their co-expression profiles, which have not previously been included in predictive surgical pathology specimen-based assays. This mIF assay has increased sensitivity and specificity for response to anti-PD1 therapy when compared to the assessment of PD-L1 expression alone in melanoma. The purpose of this proposal is to perform inter-site validation of the mIF staining assay amongst four major academic sites (Johns Hopkins, MD Anderson, Yale University, and Providence Portland Medical Center). Following analytical validation, discovery and validation cohorts from 250 patients with advanced melanoma will be used to establish final assay parameters. The deliverable of the study is a refined, mIF assay for response\/resistance to anti-PD-1 that has been validated across multiple academic sites. The result will be a multiplex IF assay that is suitably staged for advanced development aimed at clinical implementation. While melanoma is the focus of the current grant proposal, preliminary results suggest that this assay will also have great value in numerous other solid tumor types.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Marisa","family":"Bailey","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00za53h95","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4108-3282","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alex","family":"Szalay","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00za53h95","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Johns Jopkins University"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4591-2225","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Margaret","family":"Eminizer","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00za53h95","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Johns Hopkins University - Krieger School of Arts & Sciences"}]},{"given":"David","family":"Rimm","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03v76x132","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Yale University"}]},{"given":"Edwin","family":"Parra Cuentas","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4452-5947","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Bernard","family":"Fox","affiliation":[{"name":"Providence Health & Services Oregon dba Providence Portland Medical Center"}]},{"given":"Joel","family":"Sunshine","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0821-8587","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Suzanne","family":"Topalian","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00za53h95","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Drew","family":"Pardoll","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00za53h95","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Johns Hopkins University - Krieger School of Arts & Sciences"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6375-9060","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Elizabeth","family":"Engle","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00za53h95","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Liudmila","family":"Danilova","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Evan","family":"Lipson","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jennifer","family":"Montgomery","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00za53h95","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8273-4395","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Janis","family":"Taube","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00za53h95","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2976-0911","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Evan","family":"Lipson","affiliation":[]}],"award-amount":{"amount":899999.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2025,5,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"Melanoma Research Alliance","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100005190","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]],"date-time":"2022-04-06T19:23:45Z","timestamp":1649273025000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.154396"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.48050\/pc.gr.154396"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,7]],"date-time":"2022-04-07T15:13:15Z","timestamp":1649344395700},"publisher":"Melanoma Research Alliance","award":"932362","DOI":"10.48050\/pc.gr.154419","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]],"date-time":"2022-04-06T19:21:30Z","timestamp":1649272890000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.48050","member":"28092","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Alpha-synuclein\u2019s role in melanoma formation and metastasis","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Although it is well established that patients with the neurodegenerative condition Parkinson\u2019s Disease, and even their first-degree relatives, are at increased risk of getting the skin cancer melanoma, why this occurs is a mystery.

It has been suggested that normal skin melanocytes do not contain alpha-synuclein, but once these cells transform into melanoma cells they turn on expression of the alpha-synuclein protein to high levels, but for unclear reasons. We have recently discovered a previously unrecognized function for alpha-synuclein that could help us understand how Parkinson\u2019s Disease and melanoma are linked. We recently published that alpha-synuclein is, unexpectedly, involved in DNA repair within the cell nucleus. This is interesting because melanoma is known to increase levels of several other proteins involved in DNA repair, with the thought that this helps to allow melanoma cells to evade normal biological processes that shut down cell division and growth (senescence) when there is too much DNA damage. Testing this hypothesis could lead to a new class of treatments that specifically target the alpha-synuclein protein to help prevent the formation and\/or control the spread of melanoma. This is exciting because several such treatments targeting alpha-synuclein are already being developed to try to treat Parkinson\u2019s Disease and it may be possible to piggyback on this work to accelerate new treatments for melanoma.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Lisa","family":"Fitzpatrick","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/009avj582","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Oregon Health & Science University - OHSU"}]},{"given":"Pamela","family":"Cassidy","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Elizabeth","family":"Salvatierra","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/009avj582","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Oregon Health & Science University - OHSU"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8833-6542","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Vivek","family":"Unni","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/009avj582","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Oregon Health & Science University - OHSU"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":50000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2024,5,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"Melanoma Research Alliance","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100005190","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]],"date-time":"2022-04-06T19:21:30Z","timestamp":1649272890000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.154419"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.48050\/pc.gr.154419"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,7]],"date-time":"2022-04-07T15:13:16Z","timestamp":1649344396543},"publisher":"Melanoma Research Alliance","award":"937310","DOI":"10.48050\/pc.gr.154418","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]],"date-time":"2022-04-06T19:13:56Z","timestamp":1649272436000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.48050","member":"28092","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Investigating ARID2 as a suppressor of melanoma metastasis","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Melanoma is the most lethal skin cancer and when detected at an advanced stage in which cells have spread throughout the body (known as metastasis), success of currently available therapies is limited. The brain is a common site of metastasis for multiple cancer types and is associated with poor survival. Melanoma brain metastases (MBMs) occur in ~60% of metastatic melanoma patients and up to 90% at autopsy, illustrating melanoma\u2019s striking ability to access and colonize the brain. Recent genomic sequencing studies revealed an enrichment of mutations in SWI\/SNF chromatin remodeling subunits, particularly ARID2, in MBMs. However, it remains unclear how these mutations play a role in metastasis. Chromatin regulators are emerging as promising candidates for cancer therapy because of their broad roles in orchestrating genome function, as well as their frequent alterations in cancer. We found that in ARID2-deficient melanoma tumors, cancer cells are more successfully able to metastasize to distal organs in animal models. We hypothesize that genetic loss of ARID2 may also confer an advantage for melanoma metastasis to survive in the brain environment. Here, we will carefully investigate the role of ARID2 in metastasis using brain-tropic human melanoma cells in animal models through a series of experiments that recapitulate various aspects of the metastatic process to the brain and other organs. We will investigate the genes and pathways that allow these cells to do so, which will provide insight into the poorly understood mechanisms of melanoma metastasis. Finally, our study will help improve our understanding of brain metastasis with potential impact for the treatment of melanoma patients.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Jessica","family":"Moise","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/04a9tmd77","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1023-0312","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Eva","family":"Hernando","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05wthjx48","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"New York University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Jennifer","family":"Kung","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/04a9tmd77","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6533-8326","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Emily","family":"Bernstein","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/04a9tmd77","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":100000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2024,5,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"Melanoma Research Alliance","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100005190","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]],"date-time":"2022-04-06T19:13:56Z","timestamp":1649272436000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.154418"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.48050\/pc.gr.154418"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,7]],"date-time":"2022-04-07T15:13:40Z","timestamp":1649344420774},"publisher":"Melanoma Research Alliance","award":"932918","DOI":"10.48050\/pc.gr.154404","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]],"date-time":"2022-04-06T19:44:23Z","timestamp":1649274263000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.48050","member":"28092","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Investigating the role of FGL1\/LAG-3 axis in melanoma immunity","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, particularly in melanoma. Melanoma cells are different from healthy cells, they are mutating and recognized by our immune system constantly. However, melanoma cells are smart and use molecules as brake to escape being killed by the immune cells. While some of these immune brakes, such as PD-1, have been discovered, drugs blocking these do not work in most melanoma patients, and many remain unknown. To improve survival for everyone, we need to figure out what the other important brakes are so we can reprogram your own immune system to fight melanoma. LAG-3 is one of most important molecular brakes on the immune system beyond PD-1, however, it is still unclear how melanoma turn on this brake to suppress immune system. Although antibodies targeting LAG-3 have showed promising clinical signals upon PD-1 antibody combination in melanoma patients, these drugs did not work alone. We have recently discovered FGL1 as a new tumor-associated molecule that turn on LAG-3 brake. Blocking FGL1 shows improved immune cell activity and potentiates tumor killing. Moreover, FGL1 could be detected in the blood of the melanoma patients and may guide the selection of patients who may benefit from immunotherapy. Thus, we need to understand the biology of FGL1\/LAG-3 in the context of melanoma so we can design the best strategy of melanoma therapy possible. Here, we will study how FGL1 is induced in melanoma, how it suppresses tumor immunity through LAG-3, and identify strategies to maximize the clinical response targeting LAG-3 brake. Our proposal will provide critical knowledge and insights to improve melanoma immunotherapy.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Anthony","family":"Carna","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05wthjx48","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"New York University School of Medicine"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1472-1971","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Iman","family":"Osman","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05wthjx48","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"New York University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Fei","family":"Shu","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jia","family":"Liu","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lyllian","family":"Mundo","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05wthjx48","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"New York University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Flavia","family":"Camacho","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05wthjx48","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"New York University School of Medicine"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6346-2929","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jun","family":"Wang","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05wthjx48","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"New York University School of Medicine"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":255000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2025,5,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"Melanoma Research Alliance","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100005190","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]],"date-time":"2022-04-06T19:44:23Z","timestamp":1649274263000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.154404"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.48050\/pc.gr.154404"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,7]],"date-time":"2022-04-07T15:13:54Z","timestamp":1649344434696},"publisher":"Melanoma Research Alliance","award":"935329","DOI":"10.48050\/pc.gr.154417","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]],"date-time":"2022-04-06T19:17:57Z","timestamp":1649272677000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.48050","member":"28092","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Novel mouse models of uveal melanoma","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Uveal melanoma is a cancer that develops in the pigment-producing melanocytes of the eye. Approximately half of uveal melanoma patients develop metastasis, primarily to the liver, and there currently are no treatments for metastatic uveal melanoma. Consequently, uveal melanoma has only a 50% survival rate, and most patients with metastatic uveal melanoma live for less than a year. Thus, new treatment strategies are direly needed, and a better understanding of uveal melanoma biology will aid in developing such strategies. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) that faithfully recapitulate the biology and genetics of human cancer are powerful tools to better understand tumor development and to test new treatments. However, currently available uveal melanoma GEMMs lack the level of sophistication needed to serve as research tools to advance our understanding of uveal melanoma. We have developed a refined uveal melanoma GEMM which we will systematically characterize in terms of its tumor growth kinetics and gene expression profile. Moreover, we will create and characterize additional models that incorporate the most prominent uveal melanoma oncogene (MYC) and tumor suppressor (BAP1). These mouse strains will recapitulate human uveal melanomas of Categories 1-4, stages that correlate with tumor aggressiveness, and therefore represent a comprehensive series of models that will be invaluable for studying uveal melanoma. We will make these models and tools available to the uveal melanoma research community to stimulate preclinical progress that will lead to advances in the clinic.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Lowell","family":"Smith","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/01xf75524","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"H.

We found that while MM has poor overall immunogenicity, MM tumors arising from distinct anatomic sites have significant differences in immune cell profiles. Further, MM have predicted levels of activated NK cells like CM. Preliminary data revealed widespread epigenetic silencing of innate immune genes and other anti-tumor immune genes as a potential mechanism underlying poor anti-tumor immunity in MM. Screening of FDA-approved epigenetic modifying drugs in MM cells revealed the HDAC1\/2 inhibitor romidepsin strongly induces immune genes and cell surface expression of NK ligands MICA\/B.

However, there are significant differences in survival that have been identified. The American Cancer Society estimates that Black women have a 40% higher breast cancer mortality rate than White women. Studies have also demonstrated that White women with metastatic breast cancer; but not Black women have experienced improved breast cancer survival over time. \n\nThe reasons for these differences in survival are likely multifactorial. Our previous work has shown that Black women have lower white blood cell counts than White women, and as a result may experience medication dose reductions, treatment delays, and early stopping of breast cancer treatments. We have also found that Black and Hispanic patients with breast cancer are more likely to develop diabetes than White patients. Over the past few years, new oral therapies have transformed the treatment for metastatic breast cancer and these include CDK 4\/6 inhibitors and P13K\/mTOR inhibitors. While these medications improve survival of metastatic breast cancer, they also have potential serious side effects that include low blood counts and elevated blood sugar levels. \n\nFor this proposal, we will use the Flatiron Health database to evaluate more than 2.4 million patients with cancer throughout the United States. We will use this database to compare: (1) rates of use of CDK 4\/6 inhibitors and P13K\/mTOR inhibitors; (2) rates of CDK 4\/6 and P13K\/mTOR inhibitor specific toxicities; and (3) the time from treatment start to treatment discontinuation for patients who take CDK 4\/6 inhibitors and\/or P13K\/mTOR inhibitors and between Non-Hispanic-White, Black, and Hispanic patients with metastatic breast cancer.

The ultimate goal is to design interventions that will ameliorate the challenges related to access and toxicity of these medications; and possibly reduce breast cancer survival disparities across

These benign tumors are composed of neoplastic Schwann cells embedded in a microenvironment containing terminal nerve endings, fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages. While caused by loss of NF1 protein function in Schwannian lineage cells, studies in mouse plexiform neurofibroma models have revealed a critical role for non-neoplastic stromal cells (fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages) in tumor formation, maintenance, and continued growth. In this regard, inhibition of stromal cell (mast cells, macrophages) function in preclinical genetically-engineered mice resulted in attenuated plexiform neurofibroma growth. In addition to fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages, the NF1-deficient Schwann cells in cNFs often grow in proximity to terminal nerve endings. The intimate relationship between neurons and Schwann cells during normal peripheral nervous system development and function raises the intriguing possibility that neurons are important drivers of cNF growth. This notion is supported by recent studies in which the proliferation of analogous myelinating cells in the central nervous system (oligodendrocytes) is regulated by neuronal production of a novel growth factor (neuroligin-3). Based on these provocative findings, we hypothesize that peripheral sensory neurons stimulate NF1-deficient Schwann cell growth through the elaboration of mitogens. To determine\nwhether sensory neurons increase NF1-deficient Schwann cell growth, we have designed a series of milestone-driven experiments using a novel collection of patient-derived and isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells harboring NF1-patient germline NF1 gene mutations. Relevant to the mission of NTAP, these studies aim to (1) understand if peripheral (sensory) neurons contribute to cNF pathogenesis, (2) identify and elucidate the specific genetic factors that underlie cNF progression, and (3) generate a human model system to examine disease biology and enable preclinical\ntherapeutic testing.","language":"en"}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3127-5045","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"David","family":"Gutmann","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/01yc7t268","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Washington University in St.Louis"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":340044.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,30]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"JHU-NTAP \u2013 Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100014804","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,29]],"date-time":"2021-11-29T19:13:45Z","timestamp":1638213225000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.147698"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.54464\/pc.gr.147698"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,5]],"date-time":"2022-04-05T06:35:08Z","timestamp":1649140508390},"publisher":"Test accounts","award-start":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,1]]},"award":"CR-002x","DOI":"10.5555\/letstestgrants01","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,9]],"date-time":"2019-07-09T16:32:47Z","timestamp":1562689967000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.5555","member":"7822","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Improving Metadata using dogs as lap warmers","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"This is an example of a project description or abstract","language":"en"}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4011-3590","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Minerva","family":"Reuland","alternate-name":["Minnie Cat"],"affiliation":[{"name":"University of Crossref"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":24.5,"currency":"USD"},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,7]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"funding":[{"type":"equipment","scheme":"Sofa Lending Programme","award-amount":{"amount":24.5,"currency":"USD","percentage":100},"funder":{"name":"Wellcome Trust","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100004440","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,9]],"date-time":"2019-07-09T19:36:02Z","timestamp":1562700962000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http:\/\/www.crossref.org\/deleted_DOI.html"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,7]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.5555\/letstestgrants01","relation":{"is-basis-for":[{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.5555\/letstestgrants02","asserted-by":"object"}]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,27]],"date-time":"2022-04-27T23:42:54Z","timestamp":1651102974210},"publisher":"Children's Tumor Foundation","award":"CTF-2022-01-008","DOI":"10.48105\/pc.gr.154743","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,27]],"date-time":"2022-04-27T23:20:41Z","timestamp":1651101641000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.48105","member":"28169","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"From cold to hot: Reprogramming tumor microenvironment to target NF1 malignancies","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) affects about 1 in 3000 people worldwide. Patients with NF1 often develop benign tumors on the skin and along the nerves in the spinal cord and brain, and about 8-13% of those become cancerous over time. These cancerous tumors are called Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST). The only method of curing MPNST is surgical removal, however, these tumors can be large and located close to complex nerve networks, making complete removal difficult. As a result, tumors tend to reappear after surgery or tumor cells migrate to different sites like lung or bone. When complete removal cannot be achieved, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are recommended to manage the tumor. Unfortunately, MPNST respond poorly to both these therapies. With this lack of treatment options, survival of patients with MPNST is low. \nNF1 is caused by a mutation of the NF1 gene, which encodes a protein called neurofibromin. Neurofibromin acts as an off-switch for downstream signaling pathways. Therefore, inactivating mutations of the NF1 gene produce non-functional neurofibromin resulting in constant signaling of these pathways. Researchers have tried to target these pathways with various drugs to treat MPNST, however clinical trials testing these drugs against MPNST were not successful. Therefore, finding a druggable target for MPNST has been challenging. Given the difficulty of surgical and clinical management, identifying an effective treatment strategy for MPNST is a desperate need. \nA recent approach to treating inoperable, undruggable cancer has been to use Immune Checkpoint Blockers (ICB). The role of immune checkpoints is to prevent the persistence of normal immune responses to avoid possible collateral tissue damage. Cancer cells hijack this mechanism and express immune checkpoint proteins to avoid detection by a patient\u2019s immune cells. ICB disrupts this process, thus enhancing antitumor immunity. ICB has revolutionized the treatments of many cancers. However, for this approach to work, T cells and other types of immune cells must be present in the vicinity and within the tumor. Unfortunately, MPNST are \u201ccold tumors\u201d meaning they do not have many immune cells near and\/or within the tumor. This makes using ICB against MPNST challenging. \nWe hypothesize that turning MPNST into a \u201chot\u201d tumor, i.e. increasing immune cell infiltration into the tumor, will make it susceptible to targeting with ICB. In this proposal, we will use a strategy to increase the number of T cells and other immune cells near and\/or within the tumor: we will activate the cGAS-STING-IFN pathway, which enhances antitumor immunity through the production of a variety of small molecules capable of tumor cell destruction.  We will treat MPNST-bearing mice with different small-molecule drugs to activate the STING pathway, thus turning the MPNST into \u201chot\u201d tumors. We will then test various combinations of STING-activating drugs and immune checkpoint blockers to determine if they are effective in shrinking MPNST. If successful, this will represent a novel treatment strategy for MPNST, an aggressive and malignant tumor for which no molecular therapy currently exists.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Lu","family":"Le","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05byvp690","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UT Southwestern)"}]},{"given":"Cheryl","family":"Anderson","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05byvp690","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UT Southwestern)"}]},{"given":"Cheryl","family":"Anderson","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05byvp690","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UT Southwestern)"}]},{"given":"Lu","family":"Le","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05byvp690","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UT Southwestern)"}]},{"given":"Jamie","family":"Maiden","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05byvp690","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UT Southwestern)"}]},{"given":"Renee","family":"McKay","affiliation":[]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4366-9153","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Bandarigoda Nipunika","family":"Somatilaka","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05byvp690","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UT Southwestern)"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":109998.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2024,5,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"Children's Tumor Foundation","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100001545","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,27]],"date-time":"2022-04-27T23:20:41Z","timestamp":1651101641000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.154743"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.48105\/pc.gr.154743"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,1]],"date-time":"2022-04-01T16:46:46Z","timestamp":1648831606939},"publisher":"Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC)","award":"PS010","DOI":"10.47486\/ps010","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,24]],"date-time":"2020-11-24T03:50:29Z","timestamp":1606189829000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.47486","member":"26267","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"National Free Access Coronial Findings, Recommendations &amp; Responses\"","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Coroners investigate the cause and circumstances of reported death.

Modern chemotherapy regimens effect a cure in over 95% of children diagnosed, however, about 15-20% will suffer a recurrence of their lymphoma and need additional highly intensive chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. These intensive regimens have many serious chemotherapy-related side effects (infections, mouth sores, etc.). We are proposing a study to investigate a novel predictor of cancer relapse and serious chemotherapy-related side effects. For this study, we will investigate the role of body composition at Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis in cancer-free survival and chemotherapy toxicities. Body composition can be measured using computed tomography (CT) scans, which are performed routinely as part of cancer staging at diagnosis. Body composition allows us to precisely estimate the muscle and fat mass of patients, which play a role in the distribution of chemotherapy within the body. Patients with similar body-surface area receive similar doses of chemotherapy but may have markedly different body composition resulting in varied distribution of chemotherapy and hence, varied efficacy of chemotherapy and the risk of side effects. Body composition has already been shown to be a significant predictor of cancer relapse and chemotherapy toxicities in adults with cancer. We will collect data from two large studies completed by the Children\u2019s Oncology Group for children with intermediate- and high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma. We will examine the body composition of children at cancer diagnosis and examine its association with cancer-free survival and serious chemotherapy related toxicities. We will also examine how body composition changes during cancer treatment and whether that impacts survival.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Mitchell","family":"Cohen","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Amanda","family":"Dove","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/008s83205","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"}]},{"given":"Tina","family":"Ealy","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/008s83205","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"}]},{"given":"Lashaun","family":"Pryor","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7755-5683","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Smita","family":"Bhatia","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/008s83205","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"}]},{"given":"Kara","family":"Kelly","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00kg66g91","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo"}]},{"given":"Debra","family":"Friedman","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sharon","family":"Castellino","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03czfpz43","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Emory University"}]},{"family":"ws2003","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3330-6754","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Justine","family":"Kahn","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/01esghr10","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Columbia University Medical Center"}]},{"given":"Holly","family":"Simpson","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/008s83205","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"AL -

If treatment is indicated, how do we deliver care that aligns with clinical evidence and patient interests? Many men with the disease will not die from it\u2014even without any intervention. At the same time, prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death among men, underscoring the importance of quality (i.e., the right care, in the right place, at the right time). Ambiguity about whether and how to treat has resulted in tremendous variation in clinical practice, which has the potential to be further amplified by financial incentives. We have previously demonstrated that men cared for by urology practices with added incentives afforded through ownership of radiation vaults are much more likely to be treated, even if those men stand little to benefit from that treatment. \nIn this proposal, we explore the effects of physician financial incentives afforded through higher commercial prices for prostate cancer care. Physicians generally manage patients within their practice similarly regardless of the type of insurance they have. For this reason, we will assess how changes in commercial prices affect quality and spending among Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer\u2014a group of men in whom uncertainty surrounding optimal management is greatest. In contrast to other marketplaces (e.g., the automobile market), higher prices do not reduce the demand for healthcare by patients. While this is particularly true for \u201cnon-deferrable\u201d conditions (e.g., heart attack), it is also relevant for diseases like prostate cancer that provoke strong emotional responses by patients favoring treatment (i.e., the imperative to \u201cdo something\u201d in the face of a new cancer diagnosis), even when it may not be necessary. In such situations, financial incentives for physicians resulting from higher commercial prices may have both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, such incentives encouraging utilization may protect against lapses in the delivery of quality care, such as adherence to recommended diagnostic testing strategies to follow men electing for active surveillance. On the other hand, incentives may promote potentially unnecessary treatment in older, unhealthy men. \nOur findings have real-world implications for patients, who are naturally interested in getting the best possible cancer care at the lowest possible cost. Higher commercial prices invariably result in higher premiums, a phenomenon recently played out in the insurance exchanges for \u201cObamacare.\u201d Further, because cost-sharing expectations are tied to prices, raising them results in more out-of-pocket spending. Both circumstances contribute to depression, anxiety and other aspects of financial toxicity, which may decrease compliance and result in bad outcomes.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Ganesh","family":"Palapattu","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00jmfr291","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The

treatment options. The majority of these patients are also unresponsive to immunotherapy, a new form of cancer treatment that enables the body\u2019s immune cells to attack the cancer cells. We have analyzed the composition of immune cells surrounding gastric cancer, referred to as the tumor microenvironment (TME), and identified two protein receptors that are expressed in these cells: GITR and TIGIT. In this project, we will examine the effects of targeting these proteins to develop a new immunotherapy strategy for gastric cancer. We will also examine the effects of combining these targets with PD-1 immunotherapy that is currently approved for clinical use. \nWe will do this by using an innovative experimental system. This system allows us to culture a gastric cancer obtained after a patient\u2019s surgery in the laboratory and maintains all the diverse immune cell types that surround the cancer. We will use a new technology called single-cell sequencing that examines the molecules from each individual cell to understand the effects of targeting GITR, TIGIT and PD-1 in different immune cells. We will also use imaging techniques to understand the patterns of expression of these proteins in gastric cancer. From these experiments, we will determine the most effective immunotherapy targets in gastric cancer and the molecular basis for their activity. We will then apply these agents in a clinical trial by injecting them into the tumor and generating a systemic anti-tumor response. Our project has the potential to lead to a novel immunotherapy strategy for gastric cancer and improve patient survival.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Holly","family":"Osborne","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00f54p054","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University"}]},{"given":"Natalia","family":"Antanavage","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00f54p054","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University"}]},{"given":"Mona","family":"Wan","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lloyd","family":"Minor","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Heather","family":"Wakelee","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00f54p054","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University"}]},{"given":"Ronald","family":"Levy","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00f54p054","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2100-0013","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anuja","family":"Sathe","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00f54p054","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Kira","family":"Pommes","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00f54p054","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9053-0862","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alison","family":"Almeda","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00f54p054","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3772-3424","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hanlee","family":"Ji","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00f54p054","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":240000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2023,12,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]],"date-time":"2021-10-29T13:59:37Z","timestamp":1635515977000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.151075"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.151075"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,31]],"date-time":"2022-03-31T11:17:20Z","timestamp":1648725440075},"publisher":"Children's Tumor Foundation","award":"CTF-2021-05-003","DOI":"10.48105\/pc.gr.151701","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,9]],"date-time":"2021-12-09T17:46:38Z","timestamp":1639071998000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.48105","member":"28169","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Targeting endothelial cell to macrophage communication in NF1 tumors","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Neurofibromas are an essential feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and frequently undergo transformation into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), but this process is poorly understood. Macrophages, an immune cell that circulates in the blood and resides in tissues, are commonly identified in neurofibromas and MPNST, comprising nearly one-half of the entire cell population. Recent studies of mouse and human neurofibromas have suggested that neurofibroma-associated macrophages support neurofibroma growth and participate in MPNST transformation. Importantly, therapies that target macrophage signaling and ability of macrophages to differentiate into a variety of subsets are efficacious in slowing neurofibroma and MPNST growth. The response to treatment corresponds with a reduction in tumor macrophages. However, these effects appear to be temporary as both tumors begin to grow again after discontinuation of macrophage-targeted therapy.\n\nAmong many functions, macrophages support and direct new blood vessel formation, termed angiogenesis, an essential element of tumor growth. Within tumors, including those identified with NF1, macrophages are commonly found in close proximity to tumor vessels and often disappear from these areas in response to anti-tumor therapies. The close proximity to capillaries suggests that macrophages communicate with endothelial cells that line the capillaries to promote endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessels.\n\nRecently, we identified neurofibromin as a master regulator of an important mechanism for macrophage communication. Macropinocytosis, or \u2018cell drinking\u2019 is a highly conserved endocytic process utilized by macrophages to sample their environment for extracellular cues and communicate with neighboring cells. Neurofibromin-deficient MFs extensively ruffle in the absence of any stimulation and utilize macropinocytosis, but not other forms of endocytosis, to internalize extracellular fluid and solutes. Further, our recent published data compliments preliminary studies in this application that endothelial cells and tumor cells release small particles, termed exosomes, that are internalized by neighboring macrophages via macropinocytosis. Exosomes contain growth factors and other signaling molecules that allow EC and tumor cells to direct macrophages to switch phenotypes or release pro-angiogenic and pro-growth factors as a means of cyclic communication. Pharmacologic blockade of macropinocytosis disrupts exosome internalization by macrophages and subsequently impairs angiogenesis and tumor growth. Unfortunately, the most specific inhibitor of macropinocytosis, EIPA, is not FDA approved, which slows translating our observations into human therapeutic trials.\n\nIn response to this obstacle, we performed a systematic screen of the 640 FDA-approved compounds and identified imipramine as a potent, non-toxic inhibitor of macrophage macropinocytosis that is already approved for use in children and adults. In this application, we will leverage our observations that 1) loss of neurofibromin enhances macrophage macropinocytosis and internalization of endothelial and tumor cell-derived exosomes, 2) pharmacologic inhibition of macrophage macropinocytosis with a non-FDA approved compound impairs angiogenesis and tumor growth to identify whether imipramine exerts the same anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor properties of other macropinocytosis inhibitors. If our hypothesis is correct, we can quickly \u201crepurpose\u201d imipramine into human clinical trials for pNF and MPNST as well as other NF1 manifestations that are supported by macrophages (e.g. cardiovascular disease, bone abnormalities). In preparation for this potential, our immediate future direction in this application is to generate dose-response curves for imipramine using a murine tumor model relevant to NF1 to facilitate easier translation to Phase I clinical trials.","language":"en"}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1105-8895","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Brian","family":"Stansfield","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/012mef835","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Augusta University"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":85000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"Children's Tumor Foundation","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100001545","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,9]],"date-time":"2021-12-09T17:46:42Z","timestamp":1639072002000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.151701"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.48105\/pc.gr.151701"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,2]],"date-time":"2022-04-02T10:10:14Z","timestamp":1648894214963},"publisher":"American Cancer Society","award":"IRG-21-144-27-IRG","DOI":"10.53354\/pc.gr.151071","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]],"date-time":"2021-10-29T13:58:49Z","timestamp":1635515929000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.53354","member":"1849","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Institutional Research Grant","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"This application by Dr. Leon Platanias, Director of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCC) of Northwestern University (NU), seeks to renew the Institutional Research Grant (IRG) that the LCC has held for the past 27 years.  The IRG has provided beginning NU investigators with funds to conduct cancer-relevant pilot projects, enabling them to generate preliminary data that can be used to attract national funding for cancer-relevant research.  As measured by the accomplishments of the awardees subsequent to receiving IRG subawards, the IRG program at NU has been extremely successful.  Projects funded by ACS-IRG subawards have led to many publications in respected scientific journals and have laid the groundwork for successful grant applications to government agencies and national foundations.   The support provided to young investigators by the ACS-IRG is particularly crucial in the current highly competitive funding climate.\n\nThe Lurie Cancer Center employs procedures and mechanisms to implement the IRG at NU that have been tested and refined for the past 27 years.   These include procedures to widely publicize the availability of ACS-IRG funding for pilot projects, mechanisms to ensure fair and expert review of the applications by an institutional review committee, the provision of feedback to all applicants, and sound grant management.   During the current and previous two terms, a program that ensures that all pilot project awardees receive mentoring and career development guidance has been implemented, and this program will be maintained during the next term.\n\nThe Lurie Cancer Center and the local ACS office have a long history of productive interactions.  Ms. Tarneka Manning, who assumed the role of Administrative Director of the Lurie Cancer Center\u2019s Office of Equity and Minority Health during the current term, and Ms. Megan Burns, Senior Manager, Cancer Control and Strategic Partnership for the ACS, have worked to maintain and expand joint activities that impact patients, communities, health care providers, and researchers.  As has been the case in previous terms, a representative from the local ACS office will serve as a non-voting member of the institutional review committee during the next term.  \n\nThe Cancer Center is requesting funds to support four pilot projects per year.  There will no longer be funding dedicated to a \u201cspecial interest\u201d proposal;  rather such proposals   will be solicited and evaluated along with basic science, translational, and clinical research proposals.  With the anticipated continued recruitment of junior investigators with cancer-related research interests to NU, and with the policy change that allows R00 holders to apply for IRG pilot project funding, we expect continued strong interest in the funding opportunities provided by the ACS-IRG during the next term.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Michael","family":"Ferguson","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/000e0be47","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Northwestern University - Chicago Campus"}]},{"given":"Michael","family":"Moore","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/000e0be47","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Northwestern University - Chicago Campus"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9740-7573","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Leonidas","family":"Platanias","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/000e0be47","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Northwestern University - Chicago Campus"}]},{"given":"Peg","family":"Morrisroe","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/000e0be47","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Northwestern University - Evanston Campus (OSR) (Archived)"}]},{"given":"Daniel","family":"Rademacher","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/000e0be47","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Northwestern University - Chicago Campus"}]},{"given":"Benette","family":"Phillips","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/000e0be47","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Northwestern University - Chicago Campus"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9740-7573","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Leonidas","family":"Platanias","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/000e0be47","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Northwestern University - Chicago Campus"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":360000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]],"date-time":"2021-10-29T13:58:52Z","timestamp":1635515932000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.151071"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.151071"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,18]],"date-time":"2022-05-18T09:13:49Z","timestamp":1652865229459},"publisher":"Muscular Dystrophy Association","award":"628032","DOI":"10.55762\/pc.gr.87342","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,17]],"date-time":"2022-05-17T18:12:01Z","timestamp":1652811121000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.55762","member":"33899","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Mechanism of Cell Specific Injury in C9orf72 ALS and FTD","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"We will identify pathways that may cause cortical neuron degeneration in Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) versus spinal neuron degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived forebrain neurons and spinal motor neurons from patient diagnosed with C9orf72 FTD and ALS\/FTD specifically looking at the role of nuclear pore dysfunction.

Virtually no effective therapeutic options currently exist for NMDs. A critical first step towards the development of therapies, is the identification of the causative genes for NMDs. Yet, for many major NMD categories, less than 50% of genes have been discovered. At the same time, the genetic landscape of NMDs has emerged as highly heterogeneous: thus far, mutations in hundreds of genes have been identified to cause NMDs. As such, studies to identify the remaining NMD-genes cannot rely on many patients sharing a defect in the same gene, and hence often result in hundreds of candidate genes. Conventional experimental follow-up involves the design of customized assays specifically tailored to a candidate genes function, or the generation of transgenic animal models. With hundreds of candidate genes, this strategy rapidly becomes infeasible. We here propose a novel imaging-based method to unbiasedly screen for disease-associated phenotypes in patient-derived fibroblasts. Based on advanced machine-learning algorithms, our method outperforms traditional image-analysis methods by orders-of-magnitude and allows both, the direct evaluation of candidate mutations in NMD-gene discovery, and pharmacological screens for potentially therapeutic agents. We propose to apply our method to NMD-gene discovery.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Irfana","family":"Ahmed","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00hj8s172","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Columbia University"}]},{"given":"Michio","family":"Hirano","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/01esghr10","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Columbia University Medical Center"}]},{"given":"Richard","family":"Mayeux","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/01esghr10","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Columbia University Medical Center"}]},{"given":"Lee","family":"Goldman","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/01esghr10","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Columbia University Medical Center"}]},{"given":"Lucky","family":"Tran","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Irfana","family":"Ahmed","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00hj8s172","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Columbia University"}]},{"given":"Ofra","family":"Weinberger","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ofra","family":"Weinberger","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Michio","family":"Hirano","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00hj8s172","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9176-621X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Wolfgang","family":"Pernice","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/01esghr10","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Columbia University Medical Center"}]},{"given":"Anne","family":"Carpenter","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Eola","family":"Bakhru","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00hj8s172","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Trustees of Columbia University in New York"}]},{"given":"Jenny","family":"Lee","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3932-5382","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Cassandra","family":"Arnold","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00hj8s172","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Columbia University in the City of New York"}]},{"given":"Anna","family":"Shchupak","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ryan","family":"Lichtcsien","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/01esghr10","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Columbia University Medical Center"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9176-621X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Wolfgang","family":"Pernice","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/01esghr10","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Columbia University Medical Center"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":210000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"Muscular Dystrophy Association","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100005202","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,17]],"date-time":"2022-05-17T18:12:03Z","timestamp":1652811123000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.87332"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.55762\/pc.gr.87332"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,18]],"date-time":"2022-05-18T09:41:09Z","timestamp":1652866869309},"publisher":"Muscular Dystrophy Association","award":"602349","DOI":"10.55762\/pc.gr.84546","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,17]],"date-time":"2022-05-17T18:12:01Z","timestamp":1652811121000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.55762","member":"33899","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Rescue of DMD-cardiomyopathy in mdx:utrophin mice by mutant phospho-connexin-43","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and its associated cardiomyopathy are incurable. We found key evidence suggesting a detrimental role for a protein termed connexin-43 (Cx43)  in DMD-cardiomyopathy.

We also showed that inhibition of Cx43 function or genetic reduction of Cx43 rescues arrhythmias and premature death in stressed DMD mice, as well as protection from the development of heart failure. Furthermore, we found key evidence indicating that mislocalization of Cx43 is a result of altered phosphorylation of specific serine residues of Cx43, and thus, we would like to correct the defects observed in DMD cardiomyopathy by genetically manipulating this post-translational mechanism. To this end, we will incorporate a mutant form of Cx43 with altered phosphorylation sites into a severe mouse model of muscular dystrophy. Results from this study will have enormous implications for the treatment of DMD cardiomyopathy through the design of drugs that will specifically target phosphorylation in Cx43.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Sharon","family":"McFarlane","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Angelo","family":"Chrisomalis","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05vt9qd57","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3724-4132","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Junichi","family":"Sadoshima","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05vt9qd57","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Rutgers New Jersey Medical School"}]},{"given":"Deborah","family":"Lazzarino","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Tiffany","family":"Cody","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Vincent","family":"Smeraglia","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jorge","family":"Contreras","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05vt9qd57","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey-RBHS-NJMS"}]},{"given":"HOng","family":"Li","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2600-2269","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lai-hua","family":"Xie","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05vt9qd57","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Rutgers New Jersey Medical School."}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7833-5300","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Gopal","family":"Babu","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05vt9qd57","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey-RBHS-NJMS"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3724-4132","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Junichi","family":"Sadoshima","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05vt9qd57","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Rutgers New Jersey Medical School"}]},{"given":"Gloria","family":"Bailey","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05vt9qd57","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey-RBHS-NJMS"}]},{"given":"Karen","family":"Wilson","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05vt9qd57","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey - RBHS"}]},{"given":"Lidya","family":"Sanchez","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05vt9qd57","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey-RBHS-NJMS"}]},{"given":"Lamar","family":"Oglesby","affiliation":[]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5369-4446","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Diego","family":"Fraidenraich","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05vt9qd57","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey-RBHS-NJMS"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":300000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"Muscular Dystrophy Association","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100005202","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,17]],"date-time":"2022-05-17T18:12:04Z","timestamp":1652811124000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.84546"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.55762\/pc.gr.84546"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,18]],"date-time":"2022-05-18T09:41:11Z","timestamp":1652866871008},"publisher":"Muscular Dystrophy Association","award":"511619","DOI":"10.55762\/pc.gr.79106","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,17]],"date-time":"2022-05-17T18:12:01Z","timestamp":1652811121000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.55762","member":"33899","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"PET Imaging of Inflammation and Epigenetics in People with ALS","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"The two major limitations for developing effective treatments for people with ALS are: limited understanding of ALS causes and lack of tools to test promising treatments in patients.

Upon binding to testosterone, AR enters the nucleus of the cell and binds DNA where it drives the transcription of certain genes. The mutation confers AR toxic properties which lead to primary degeneration of motor neurons and muscle in patients, via mechanisms which are not completely elucidated. The activity of AR and other hormone receptors of the same superfamily, such as progesterone and oestrogen receptors, can be modulated in human cells by a number of isoforms and\/or splice variants, which may block or enhance their functions, allowing for control of the nuclear receptor activity in a cell-specific manner. In this work, our overarching aim is to investigate the role of AR alternative isoforms in mediating SBMA toxicity. By revealing how these isoforms regulate AR activity in health and disease, we expect to: i) increase the understanding of the mechanisms of disease in SBMA and ii) provide a novel rational therapeutic target, with high potential to be translated into a clinically suitable strategy. If successful, the work could pinpoint tissue-specific targets for therapy development, with implications not only for SBMA, but for other diseases of the motor unit as well, including spinal muscular atrophy and ALS.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Daniel","family":"Blakey","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/052gg0110","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Oxford"}]},{"given":"MATTHEW","family":"WOOD","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/052gg0110","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Oxford"}]},{"given":"David","family":"Paterson","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gavin","family":"Screaton","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alison","family":"Brindle","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Daniel","family":"Blakey","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/052gg0110","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Oxford"}]},{"given":"Christopher","family":"Grunseich","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/01s5ya894","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH NINDS"}]},{"given":"Sally","family":"Vine","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/052gg0110","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Oxford"}]},{"given":"Chantelle","family":"Alderson","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Stephen","family":"Barker","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/052gg0110","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Oxford"}]},{"given":"Khaya","family":"Rowland","affiliation":[]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8307-6638","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Carlo","family":"Rinaldi","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/052gg0110","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Oxford"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":153933.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"Muscular Dystrophy Association","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100005202","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,17]],"date-time":"2022-05-17T18:12:37Z","timestamp":1652811157000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.81520"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.55762\/pc.gr.81520"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,18]],"date-time":"2022-05-18T10:41:31Z","timestamp":1652870491684},"publisher":"Muscular Dystrophy Association","award":"573414","DOI":"10.55762\/pc.gr.81533","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,17]],"date-time":"2022-05-17T18:12:01Z","timestamp":1652811121000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.55762","member":"33899","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Engineering Novel Knock-in Mouse Models Of Sporadic ALS","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease resulting from loss of motor neurons, leading to paralysis and eventually death. There are no effective therapies for ALS. The major disease hallmark found in most ALS patient is called TDP-43, a protein that accumulates in the brain and spinal cord and is implicated in the death of neurons.  Unfortunately, little is known about how TDP-43 becomes toxic, partly because it has been so challenging to study TDP-43 in animals; slightly elevating or reducing TDP-43 levels can be quite toxic to cells, posing unique challenges in recreating ALS models. Our goal is to generate better ALS models containing the toxic forms of TDP-43; models that faithfully mirror the human disease. The implications are clear. Better ALS models will allow us to test the effectiveness and the clinical potential of emerging ALS drugs. We made significant progress towards this goal already. We used a new technology called CRISPR\/cas9 to insert a specific mutation directly into the mouse genome to generate a first-of-its-kind ALS model that displays many of the hallmarks of human ALS including the toxic accumulation of TDP-43 as well as motor impairments that resemble those seen ALS patients. In this proposal, we will establish these TDP-43 mutant mice as a next-generation ALS model that could dramatically accelerate the testing of potentially effective therapies for eventual translation to human patients.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Jenifer","family":"Gwaltney","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0130frc33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}]},{"given":"William","family":"Powers","affiliation":[]},{"given":"William","family":"Roper","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Karem","family":"McCall","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Judith","family":"Cone","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sheryl","family":"Moy","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jeremy","family":"Simon","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Nhandi","family":"Kenion","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0130frc33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}]},{"given":"Jenifer","family":"Gwaltney","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0130frc33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}]},{"given":"Robert","family":"Statts","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0130frc33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC"}]},{"given":"Anne","family":"Goldstein","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Matthew","family":"Johnston","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0130frc33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4099-0278","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Todd","family":"Cohen","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0130frc33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":300000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"Muscular Dystrophy Association","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100005202","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,17]],"date-time":"2022-05-17T18:12:19Z","timestamp":1652811139000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.81533"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.55762\/pc.gr.81533"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,18]],"date-time":"2022-05-18T11:11:23Z","timestamp":1652872283029},"publisher":"Muscular Dystrophy Association","award":"515810","DOI":"10.55762\/pc.gr.79226","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,17]],"date-time":"2022-05-17T18:12:01Z","timestamp":1652811121000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.55762","member":"33899","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Evaluation of therapeutic approaches for FLNC myofibrillar myopathy","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"We have generated zebrafish models for myofibrillar myopathy, due to mutation of Filamin C, that reproduce the key symptoms of protein aggregation and muscle fiber failure.

This suggests two therapeutic approaches, increasing the level of the functional protein and removing the protein aggregates. \n\nWe will use drug treatments to promote the upregulation of protein degradation pathways in our disease models and determine their effectiveness at reducing the protein aggregates. We will also investigate drugs targeting pathways that control Filamin C protein levels. \n\nOur previous work has also demonstrated that another protein, BAG3, prevents the removal of the disease causing form of Filamin C from the body. We will therefore investigate drugs that inhibit BAG3 as a third possible therepeutic option. \n\nAll three approaches will be tested in the zebrafish models to determine their effectiveness at reducing disease severity. The most promising compounds from each approach will be then evaluated in a long-term study using zebrafish that have been genetically modified to match change found in patients.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Karen","family":"McConalogue","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02bfwt286","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Monash University"}]},{"given":"Margaret","family":"Gardner","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Cristina","family":"Varsavsky","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Stacey","family":"Mair","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Emily","family":"McKaige","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Brett","family":"Waldegrave","affiliation":[]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9501-8208","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Robert","family":"Bryson-Richardson","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02bfwt286","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Monash University"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":273962.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"Muscular Dystrophy Association","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100005202","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,17]],"date-time":"2022-05-17T18:12:38Z","timestamp":1652811158000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.79226"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.55762\/pc.gr.79226"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,18]],"date-time":"2022-05-18T11:11:24Z","timestamp":1652872284940},"publisher":"Muscular Dystrophy Association","award":"573406","DOI":"10.55762\/pc.gr.81530","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,17]],"date-time":"2022-05-17T18:12:01Z","timestamp":1652811121000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.55762","member":"33899","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Monomeric Gene Editing Enzymes to Treat Mitochondrial Myopathies","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are most often heteroplasmic, meaning that the normal mtDNA co-exists with the mutant mtDNA.

Indeed, the therapeutic potential of IFN has been an active area of research for more than 50 years with &gt;100 active or recruiting clinical trials exploring IFN as a primary or adjuvant treatment for various cancers. Moreover, endogenous expression of IFN has been established as a cancer prognostic and can inform treatment strategy. Therefore, understanding how cells respond to IFN, as well as the mechanisms that regulate IFN induction, are important to understand cancer. My proposal seeks to characterize a specific mechanism that prevent cells from aberrantly overproducing IFN. This is significant as mis-regulation of IFN expression in patients can complicate IFN-based cancer treatments. My preliminary data show that loss of a specific IFN-induced RNA binding protein (RBP) results in overproduction of IFN. As cellular signaling driven by IFN is not sufficient to induce IFN, my data suggest this RBP suppresses aberrant IFN expression. IFN is normally induced when cells recognize RNA pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that can arise from viral infection or mis-regulated cellular RNA. Therefore, this suggests the aberrant IFN expression described above is induced by a self-RNA PAMP activating cellular signaling that leads to IFN induction . Further my data suggest that the IFN-induced RBP binds to this self-RNA PAMP to suppress this signaling. Importantly, I have found that this IFN-induced RBP specifically recognizes PAMP-like RNAs that are double-stranded and contain RNA modifications. These data are consistent with a model in which this IFN-induced RBP binds mis-regulated cellular RNA to protect cells from activating PAMP recognition pathways that lead to IFN-expression. My proposal will test this model by determining the RNA binding mechanisms and signaling pathways controlled by this IFN-induced RBP to protect cells against aberrant IFN-induction. Results of this study will provide novel insight into regulation of the innate immune system and inform future development of IFN-based treatments.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Jennifer","family":"McCallister","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03njmea73","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Duke University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Joseph","family":"Heitman","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03njmea73","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Duke University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Gail","family":"Bullock","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00py81415","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Duke University"}]},{"given":"Tonya","family":"Peace","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00py81415","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Duke University"}]},{"given":"Stacy","family":"Horner","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jennifer","family":"McCallister","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Eric","family":"Burkhalter","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03njmea73","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Duke University School of Medicine"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3813-9254","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Matthew","family":"Thompson","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03njmea73","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Duke University School of Medicine"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":175500.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]],"date-time":"2021-10-29T14:06:01Z","timestamp":1635516361000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.151087"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.151087"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,30]],"date-time":"2022-03-30T14:24:31Z","timestamp":1648650271803},"publisher":"Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC)","award":"PS031","DOI":"10.47486\/ps031","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,24]],"date-time":"2020-11-24T03:50:29Z","timestamp":1606189829000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.47486","member":"26267","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Leveraging data to support young people\u2019s education and wellbeing\"","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"State and territory education departments hold comprehensive administrative databases that include socioeconomic, demographic and cultural information, student enrolment and attendance, behaviour management, wellbeing and engagement, disability, access to psycho-social services and of course academic achievement.

In addition, more patients are undergoing genetic testing, allowing researchers to recognize that more patients have germline genetic changes than was previously thought. In fact, these germline changes are also detected in patients without a strong personal or family history of cancer, making the relationship between the germline change and risk of developing cancer unknown. In this proposal, we aim to use genetic sequencing data from a cohort of over 4,000 patients with metastatic cancer to better understand whether or not these germline changes are directly linked to cancer development. We also aim to determine if patients who receive cancer treatment based on these germline findings have improvement in their cancer treatment outcomes.

There is an urgent need to better understand the biology underlying pancreatic tumor development so that we can develop more effective therapies. When tumors begin to grow, they are characterized by uncontrolled growth of the tumor cells. As these cells expand, there is a response in the normal cells that surround the growing tumor. Support cells in the area, called fibroblasts, can serve as sentinels, recognizing a problem in the tissue and responding in an attempt to organize repair of the tissue. The fibroblasts rapidly expand in cell number, and they lay down a matrix of protein fibers that, if left uncontrolled, can resemble the tough matrix of a scar. These fibroblasts also send signals to other normal cells in the body including the immune cells and blood vessel cells that play important roles in the wound or injury response. \n\nRecent work in pancreatic cancer has uncovered the existence of many different types of fibroblasts in cancer that play different roles in tumor biology. While some fibroblasts support tumor cells and drive early tumor growth, others appear to be able to restrict tumor growth. Importantly, it appears that certain conditions or treatments can change fibroblasts from tumor supporting cells into tumor restricting cells, and vice versa. Our long-term research goal is to determine how fibroblasts choose which type of fibroblast to be, and then to understand the impact each type of fibroblast has on pancreatic cancer development and growth. Ultimately, we want to be able to control these processes therapeutically in order to program the fibroblasts to restrict tumor growth. \n\nIn our preliminary data, we found an exciting role for an enzyme called PIN1 in regulating the type of fibroblasts present in pancreatic cancer. Fibroblasts without PIN1 exist in a different state than those with this enzyme. Without PIN1, fibroblasts send out different signals to neighboring cells, and we found that these different signals help restrict tumor growth. Since tumors that lack PIN1 grow much more slowly, we are very enthusiastic about the ability to therapeutically regulate PIN1 in order to change the fibroblast type and prevent tumor growth. In this proposal, we will investigate at the molecular level how PIN1 affects fibroblast state. We will use mouse models of cancer and 3D bioprinted human pancreatic tumor tissues to dissect the full impact of PIN1 loss on the tumor environment. Finally, we will determine whether changing the fibroblast types by removing PIN1 function can inhibit early tumor initiation and growth. Ultimately, we think this work will provide new treatment and prevention strategies for pancreatic cancer, and hope that it will give insight long-term into the treatment of other cancers as well.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Susan","family":"Hayflick","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/009avj582","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Oregon Health & Science University - OHSU"}]},{"given":"Travis","family":"Cook","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/009avj582","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Oregon Health & Science University - OHSU"}]},{"given":"Mark","family":"Derby","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/009avj582","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Oregon Health & Science University - OHSU"}]},{"given":"Sponsored Projects","family":"Administration","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rudy","family":"Razo","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/009avj582","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Oregon Health & Science University - OHSU"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0352-1859","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ellen","family":"Langer","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/009avj582","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Oregon Health & Science University - OHSU"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":792000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2026,6,30]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T01:13:00Z","timestamp":1653527580000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.153686"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.153686"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T12:13:26Z","timestamp":1653567206298},"publisher":"American Cancer Society","award":"DICRIDG-21-071-01-DICRIDG","DOI":"10.53354\/pc.gr.147187","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T01:12:56Z","timestamp":1653527576000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.53354","member":"1849","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Meharry ACS Diversity Cancer Research and Development Grant \"(MADCRDG)\"","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Meharry ACS Diversity Cancer Research and Development Grant proposes to provide cancer research and training to junior cancer research faculty through pilot project  program,  two Physician-Scientists,  2 Postdoctoral Fellows, and  6 MS fellowship within a 4-year period.

We will endeavor to recruit more African Americans and other minorities to the program. During their training they will  work with any of our senior cancer research faculty. Currently, there are ongoing cancer research projects on breast cancer, colon cancer, leukemia, HPV, cancer immunology, prostate cancer and ovarian cancer. Our program will provide ACS support to each pilot project investigator for 1 year. However, the Physician-Scientists will be supported for 4 years based on their overall progress and performance while they work under the mentorship of cancer-specific research mentors and will receive mentorship from a Blue Sky Teams. The postdocs will be supported by ACS postdoctoral fellowship for two years while each receives cancer research training and mentorship under both cancer research-specific mentor and a mentorship team. The MSPH trainees will be supported by a two-year ACS MS fellowship to receive training in cancer prevention and control. We have also proposed to work with a program evaluator who will monitor the progress of the program to ensure that all our cancer research trainees meet their milestones and timelines. To that end, we have provided a logic model for the entire proposal, which will guide the program evaluator and ensure effective evaluation. Our goal is to utilize the evaluative report and recommendations to take corrective measures to enhance outstanding program outcomes. We expect that by the end of this four-year funding period, we would have successfully trained 2 cancer research Physician-Scientists to become career cancer research scientists who will contribute to understanding the mechanisms of cancer as well as contribute towards addressing cancer disparities. We equally expect that our pilot project investigators would submit and seek their independent cancer grants. In addition, we expect our Postdoc and MS fellows to advance in  their respective career pathways to join the cancer research workforce and help to increase our knowledge on cancer and cancer prevention and control. In summary, research to be conducted by these cancer research trainees and their mentors will contribute towards our understanding of TNBC, colon cancer, HPV-related cancer, cancer immunology, and ovarian cancer. Successful completion of the strategies described in this proposal, will enable us to increase the number of minorities in the cancer research workforce as well as contribute to understanding and addressing cancer disparities.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Gamaliel","family":"Ballard","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00k63dq23","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Meharry Medical College"}]},{"given":"Zulfat","family":"Suara","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Zulfat","family":"Suara","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6372-3669","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anil","family":"Shanker","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00k63dq23","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Meharry Medical College"}]},{"given":"Aramandla","family":"Ramesh","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00k63dq23","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Meharry Medical College"}]},{"given":"Zhenbang","family":"Chen","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6372-3669","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anil","family":"Shanker","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00k63dq23","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Meharry Medical College"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8581-7778","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Samuel","family":"Adunyah","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00k63dq23","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Meharry Medical College"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":2630000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,30]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T01:13:12Z","timestamp":1653527592000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.147187"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.147187"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T12:13:27Z","timestamp":1653567207846},"publisher":"American Cancer Society","award":"RSG-22-077-01-CCB","DOI":"10.53354\/pc.gr.153702","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T01:12:56Z","timestamp":1653527576000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.53354","member":"1849","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Overcoming Drug Resistance in Hedgehog Pathway-Driven Cancers","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma (MB) together inflict significant morbidity and mortality. Over four million new cases of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are diagnosed every year in the US, while medulloblastoma (MB) is the most frequently observed malignant brain cancer in children, accounting for 20% of all pediatric brain tumors.  These cancers frequently arise from defects in a critical protein known as Smoothened (SMO).  Cells in our bodies switch on the SMO protein during development, initiating a series of molecular events that build our tissues and organs.  Inappropriate activation of SMO in adult tissues, however, causes skin, brain, and muscle cell cancers such as BCC and MB. In the short term, drugs that shut SMO off, known as SMO inhibitors, can block the progression of these tumors. Unfortunately, SMO inhibitors ultimately lose their effectiveness because the tumor, in an effort to continue growing, creates mutations in SMO that prevent the drugs from acting. This phenomenon, known as drug resistance, can leave patients with few or no other therapeutic options as their tumors proliferate out of control.\n\nThe goal of my lab is to develop new SMO inhibitors that do not suffer from drug resistance problems. To accomplish this goal, we first need to learn in molecular terms how SMO is switched on to initiate tumor formation, and how inhibitors block this process. We can then understand how mutations that arise in SMO during cancer progression prevent the inhibitors from working, and how to avoid this issue when designing new drugs.  For many years, the SMO activation mechanism was a huge scientific mystery. However, my lab recently made major inroads into this question by using a technique called crystallography to capture a snapshot of SMO activation in high-resolution atomic detail. This breakthrough revealed how SMO becomes activated in cells, and why the current SMO inhibitors all succumb to resistance. Based on these insights, we now have a new strategy to inhibit SMO that will be much harder for cancer cells to resist. \n\nThe goal of my ACS proposal is to evaluate this therapeutic strategy, and to test whether it is superior to the existing standard of care.  We will accomplish this in two ways. First, we will conduct experiments to rigorously test our model of SMO activation and inhibitor resistance in cancer cells. Second, we will test whether our proposed SMO inhibition strategy blocks SMO effectively and avoids the emergence of resistance. Our studies will use cancer cells that can be grown and studied in our lab, along with new animal systems that model the emergence of drug resistance in BCC and MB. We expect our research to generate new knowledge of how these tumors arise, how drug resistance develops, and how we can overcome this resistance. This knowledge is vital for the development of new drugs that will significantly reduce the burden of tumors throughout the population and improve the quality of life for cancer patients.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Debbie","family":"Arnold","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03r0ha626","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Utah"}]},{"given":"Sally","family":"Petersen","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Bradley","family":"Cairns","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03r0ha626","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Utah"}]},{"given":"Rebecca","family":"Gudmundson","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03r0ha626","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Utah"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1220-1830","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rodney","family":"Stewart","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03r0ha626","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Utah"}]},{"given":"Douglas","family":"Grossman","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03r0ha626","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Utah"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4983-6610","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Samuel","family":"Cheshier","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/04mvr1r74","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Intermountain Healthcare Foundation"}]},{"given":"Randall","family":"Peterson","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2812-1042","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Martin","family":"McMahon","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03r0ha626","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Utah"}]},{"given":"Callie","family":"Martens","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03r0ha626","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Utah"}]},{"given":"Ryan","family":"Tuohy","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03r0ha626","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Utah"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0975-539X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Benjamin","family":"Myers","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03r0ha626","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of Utah"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":792000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2026,6,30]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T01:12:57Z","timestamp":1653527577000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.153702"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.153702"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T12:41:10Z","timestamp":1653568870152},"publisher":"American Cancer Society","award":"RSG-22-064-01-RMC","DOI":"10.53354\/pc.gr.153690","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T01:12:56Z","timestamp":1653527576000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.53354","member":"1849","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Sex specific stress granules in leukemogenesis","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"The incidence and severity of many types of human cancers differ between males and females, even after adjusting for known risk factors. For example, there are a higher incidence and worse progression in males than females in several types of leukemia. Sex-biased effects on the incidence and progression of these cancers are well known and attributed mainly to hormone or epigenetic differences; however, these differences alone are insufficient to account for the magnitude of sex-related differences in human cancers. Genetic regulation of gene expression plays an essential role in cancers. In fact, males and females are only 98.5% genetically identical. Understanding sex-specific gene regulation will promote precision medicine and better cancer treatment. One of the major keys to sex-biased differences lies in the sex chromosomes. Although the X and Y chromosomes are by and large not homologous, a handful of X chromosome-encoded proteins have Y chromosome-encoded homologs. In the past, these Y chromosome-encoded homologs were thought to only express and function in the reproductive system. However, growing evidence suggests that Y chromosome-encoded homologs are ectopically expressed in human cancers. For instance, DDX3Y (which has an X chromosome-encoded homolog DDX3X) ectopically expresses malignant male hematopoietic cells. Despite this, the functional differences between the protein homologs encoded on the X and Y chromosomes have not been rigorously investigated outside the reproductive tract. We currently lack an understanding of the impact of sex chromosome homolog proteins on sex differences in disease incidence and progression, as the function of these proteins is typically studied in a gender-neutral manner. Many experts, including Dr. David Page, in the field of sex differences in human disease, have highlighted the importance of using a combination of biochemical, genetic, and cell biological approaches to thoroughly compare the functions of these sex chromosome homolog to understand the contribution of sex chromosome homolog more fully in sex differences in human health and disease. With my lab\u2019s expertise in RNA biology and translation regulation, we are well-positioned to study the functional difference between RNA helicases DDX3X and DDX3Y to address whether they play a role in sex differences, using biochemical and cell-based approaches. Specifically, we will utilize sex-defined patient-derived leukemia cells to reveal the function and functional differences between DDX3X and DDX3Y in leukemogenesis. We use a combination of biochemical and cellular approaches to elucidate the differences between DDX3X and DDX3Y in the regulation of translation in leukemogenesis at the molecular level. Completing this study will create a sex-defined tractable model system to study the difference between DDX3X and DDX3Y in regulating RNA translation in supporting leukemogenesis. Future work will build upon this understanding to determine how these mechanisms may affect the development of sex-biased human cancers.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Viviane","family":"Martin","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Amy","family":"Camilleri","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00b30xv10","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania"}]},{"given":"Kristen","family":"Lynch","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Amy","family":"Camilleri","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00b30xv10","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5943-3888","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Fange","family":"Liu","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00b30xv10","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":792000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2026,6,30]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T01:13:19Z","timestamp":1653527599000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.153690"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.153690"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T12:41:10Z","timestamp":1653568870934},"publisher":"American Cancer Society","award":"PF-22-066-01-TBE","DOI":"10.53354\/pc.gr.153674","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T01:12:56Z","timestamp":1653527576000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.53354","member":"1849","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Targeting mitochondrial function as a therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Despite a well-defined understanding of the genetic basis of pancreatic cancer, harnessing this information to develop effective clinical therapies has been a major challenge. Consequently, this devastating disease remains one of the deadliest cancers in the U.S. With only 10% of patients surviving more than five years past their initial diagnosis and no effective therapies in the clinic, the prognosis of pancreatic cancer is incredibly grim. Thus, we urgently need to discover better treatments to improve the survival of these patients. One promising therapeutic approach is to block the activities of KRAS, a gene which is mutated in over 95% of pancreatic cancers. Preclinical research studies showed that blocking KRAS activities causes dramatic pancreatic cancer regression, establishing KRAS and its regulated activities as major therapeutic targets. Importantly, recent findings showed that KRAS reprograms pancreatic cancer cell metabolism to meet the increased energy demands of malignant cells. One key target for this metabolic reprogramming is mitochondria, the key supplier of energy in the cell. I hypothesize that the development of therapies that can target the mitochondria will starve pancreatic cancer, blocking malignant growth. To accomplish this, my project will take two directions. First, recent studies found that loss of KRAS activity causes a dramatic change in mitochondrial shape from fragmented to elongated, which disrupts mitochondrial function and reduces tumor growth. This suggests that manipulating mitochondrial shape and activity may be a promising way to reduce cancer burden. However, we still lack a clear understanding of how exactly KRAS manipulates mitochondrial behaviors to aid pancreatic cancer cell growth. My proposed research will address this significant knowledge gap. I propose to test how changes in mitochondrial shape will either promote or suppress pancreatic cancer metabolism and growth. I will also examine how changes in mitochondrial shape might cause new dependencies on other metabolic processes and then investigate ways to block multiple metabolic activities at once. Second, an investigational drug called ONC201 has been recently shown to degrade important mitochondrial proteins and block mitochondrial energy production. ONC201 is currently being evaluated in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for the treatment of several other cancer types. Because pancreatic cancer cells rely on mitochondria for energy production and survival, I propose that ONC201 will also be an effective drug to block pancreatic cancer cell growth. Using preclinical cancer models, I will perform experiments to demonstrate that ONC201 can inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth and metabolism. Ultimately, I hope that successful completion of my studies will advance our knowledge about the ways by which pancreatic cancer cells rely on mitochondrial activity for survival and be used to develop new methods to treat one of the deadliest human cancers.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Penny","family":"Gordon-Larsen","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0130frc33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1229-4619","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Henry","family":"Earp","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0130frc33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}]},{"given":"Channing","family":"Der","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0130frc33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}]},{"given":"Jacqueline","family":"Quay","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0130frc33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC"}]},{"given":"Jenifer","family":"Gwaltney","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0130frc33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}]},{"given":"Channing","family":"Der","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0130frc33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5595-7219","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sarah","family":"Howard","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0130frc33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7049-2934","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kristina","family":"Drizyte-Miller","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0130frc33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":175500.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,30]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T01:12:58Z","timestamp":1653527578000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.153674"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.153674"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T12:41:12Z","timestamp":1653568872534},"publisher":"American Cancer Society","award":"PEP-22-028-01-CTSP","DOI":"10.53354\/pc.gr.153671","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T01:12:56Z","timestamp":1653527576000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.53354","member":"1849","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Early Palliative Care Following Aborted Cancer Surgery: Characterizing and Addressing Patient Needs","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Surgery is the primary treatment for most early stage solid-organ cancers. Unfortunately, occasionally surgery may be unexpectedly aborted, most often because of occult metastatic disease or unanticipated unresectability. For most cancer types, the inability to undergo resection of one\u2019s cancer precludes the potential for a curative outcome. Following aborted cancer surgery, patients experience many of the same surgical symptoms, need for recovery, and risk of complications as patients who undergo successful curative-intent surgery, while simultaneously experiencing the psychosocial distress of a major change in their prognosis and the side effects of the cancer left in situ. Palliative care, with its emphasis on symptom management, addressing psychosocial distress, clarifying patient preferences, and facilitating decision-making, may improve patient outcomes following aborted cancer surgery. While palliative care referrals have traditionally been reserved for late-stage patients, more recent research has highlighted the beneficial effects of early palliative care referral for patients with advanced cancers.\n\nLittle research has been conducted on the experience, preferences, or care needs of patients who have experienced an aborted cancer surgery. In this study, we will first seek to understand the experience of patients who underwent aborted cancer surgery through semi-structured interviews. Then we will test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of early palliative care referral in a prospective clinical trial. This research should identify opportunities to improve the quality of cancer care delivery and will serve as important preliminary data for the design of larger multicenter trials confirming the efficacy of early palliative care interventions following aborted cancer surgery.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Karie","family":"Kennedy","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00rs6vg23","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Ohio State University"}]},{"given":"Timothy","family":"Pawlik","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00rs6vg23","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Ohio State University"}]},{"given":"David","family":"Mess","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Karie","family":"Kennedy","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00rs6vg23","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Ohio State University"}]},{"given":"Sharla","family":"Wells-Di Gregorio","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00rs6vg23","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Ohio State University"}]},{"given":"Sachin","family":"Kale","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00rs6vg23","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Ohio State University"}]},{"given":"Jacob","family":"Carroll","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00rs6vg23","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Ohio State University"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2373-8433","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jordan","family":"Cloyd","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00rs6vg23","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Ohio State University"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":144000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,30]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T01:13:07Z","timestamp":1653527587000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.153671"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.153671"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T12:41:12Z","timestamp":1653568872552},"publisher":"American Cancer Society","award":"DICRIDG-21-072-01-DICRIDG","DOI":"10.53354\/pc.gr.147215","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T01:12:56Z","timestamp":1653527576000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.53354","member":"1849","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Diversity in Cancer Research Institutional Development Grant","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) was founded in 1975 as the Medical Education Program at Morehouse College.

After decades of research, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related death worldwide. A critical goal in lung cancer biology research is identifying unique molecular features that contribute to lung cancer progression to develop novel precision therapies for patients. Glycogen is the primary source of carbohydrate storage in most issues, and its degradation products are intimately connection to central carbon metabolism. Recently, aberrant glycogen accumulation has been observed in lung tumors and been reported to promote lung cancer progression. Despite these findings, the full clinical implications of dysregulated glycogen metabolism and its role in lung cancer tumorigenesis remain largely unstudied. \n\nOur preliminary data demonstrate that lung tumors exhibit elevated glycogen content with increased branching and phosphorylation. We hypothesize that accumulation of structurally unique glycogen is a critical component of lung cancer metabolism and contributes to tumorigenesis and disease progression. In this proposal, we will utilize cutting-edge metabolomics, mass spectrometry imaging, and multiplexed-imaging analyses to test the hypothesis that cellular perturbations mediated by dysregulated glycogen metabolism drive tumor progression in vivo, as well as evaluate glycogen as a therapeutic intervention in preclinical models of lung cancer. Ultimately, these findings will advance our knowledge of lung cancer biology and drive the discovery of novel precision therapies and disease biomarkers for lung cancer patients.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Kim","family":"Carter","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02k3smh20","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Kentucky Research Foundation"}]},{"given":"Sabrina","family":"Darnell","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02k3smh20","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Kentucky college of medicine"}]},{"given":"Luke","family":"Bradley","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02k3smh20","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Kentucky Research Foundation"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3009-1850","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ramon","family":"Sun","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02k3smh20","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Kentucky Research Foundation"}]},{"given":"Bernard","family":"Evers","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02k3smh20","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Kentucky Research Foundation"}]},{"given":"Kim","family":"Carter","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02k3smh20","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Kentucky Research Foundation"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3009-1850","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ramon","family":"Sun","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02k3smh20","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Kentucky Research Foundation"}]},{"given":"Bernard","family":"Evers","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02k3smh20","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Kentucky Research Foundation"}]},{"given":"Tyler","family":"Justice","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02k3smh20","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Kentucky Research Foundation"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4593-0896","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lindsey","family":"Conroy","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02k3smh20","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Kentucky Research Foundation"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":175500.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2025,10,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]],"date-time":"2022-05-26T01:13:03Z","timestamp":1653527583000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.153672"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.153672"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,2]],"date-time":"2022-04-02T19:36:03Z","timestamp":1648928163778},"publisher":"American Cancer Society","award":"RSG-21-120-01-TBE","DOI":"10.53354\/pc.gr.151096","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]],"date-time":"2021-10-29T14:06:59Z","timestamp":1635516419000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.53354","member":"1849","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"USP13 in Mitochondrial Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway and Ovarian Cancer","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) is the most commonly diagnosed form of ovarian cancer and the most lethal cause of gynecological cancer death. The ultimate goal is to improve the long-term outcomes of women with ovarian cancer. Mitochondria play a central role in supplying energy and metabolites for the fast proliferation of cancer cells. Therefore, metabolic pathway alteration in cancer cells may render them highly dependent on specific metabolic enzymes or processes, which can be exploited for cancer therapy. However, targeting cancer metabolism has a limitation because of our lack of understanding of which metabolic pathways are altered and how they are regulated in cancer. A deubiquitinating enzyme, USP13, regulates the protein degradation or function by removing ubiquitin from the specific target proteins. USP13 gene is highly amplified, which is one of the most common genomic alterations in HGSOC. In the proposed work, we will investigate the influence of USP13 on ovarian cancer initiation and progression through the regulation of the stability of mitochondrial proteins and metabolic pathways. Our goal is to enhance our understanding of interrelationships between deubiquitination, mitochondrial function, and ovarian cancer development. Ovarian cancer can develop in women of all ages.

Metastatic cancer is very difficult to treat because metastases can be very small and disperse all throughout the body, which means that they cannot all be surgically removed. As a result, metastatic cancer must be treated with drugs. However, the drugs we currently have to treat metastatic cancer are not very effective. Indeed, metastasis causes the majority of all cancer deaths, including lung cancer, which is itself the most frequent cause of cancer deaths in the world. Accordingly, there is a great need to develop a better understanding of metastatic cancer to enable the development of new therapies to treat cancers once they have metastasized. One promising approach is immunotherapy, which involves turning the body's own immune system against a cancer. However, developing immunotherapies against lung cancer first demands a better understanding of how this immune evasion happens, so that we can figure out how to bring metastatic cancer out of hiding. In this project, I will use models of lung cancer metastasis in mice in which I can simultaneously test many different genes that cancer cells might be using to enable immune evasion. By labeling each cell in a way that allows me to track which gene is turned off, I can look for which cells are able to grow in metastatic sites, and thereby figure out which genes are important for metastatic growth in different organs. Furthermore, I will perform experiments where metastatic cancer cells either do or do not encounter an immune response designed to target them. These results will uncover genes that are crucial for allowing these cancer cells to avoid elimination by the immune system. This knowledge could be critical for the development of future therapies that use the immune system to eliminate metastatic cancer, no matter where it has spread.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"Angela","family":"Au","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00f54p054","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University"}]},{"given":"Monte","family":"Winslow","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00f54p054","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University"}]},{"given":"Dmitri","family":"Petrov","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00f54p054","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"CA - 166\/205 - Stanford University"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0784-7987","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Michael","family":"Snyder","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00f54p054","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Karin","family":"Immergluck","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Timothy","family":"Reuter","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00f54p054","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8778-5941","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jess","family":"Hebert","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00f54p054","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":175500.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]],"date-time":"2021-10-29T14:06:00Z","timestamp":1635516360000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.151083"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.151083"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,3]],"date-time":"2022-04-03T19:27:46Z","timestamp":1649014066296},"publisher":"American Cancer Society","award":"IRG-21-143-01-IRG","DOI":"10.53354\/pc.gr.151064","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]],"date-time":"2021-10-29T13:58:49Z","timestamp":1635515929000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.53354","member":"1849","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Institutional Research Grant","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"The American Cancer Society Institutional Research Grant (ACS IRG) would be a terrific new mechanism for the Stony Brook Cancer Center (SBCC) to recruit new faculty into cancer research and to nurture the untested ideas of junior faculty already involved in cancer research. Over the past 25 years, pilot programs at the institution (e.g. the Carol Baldwin Breast Cancer awards) have successfully encouraged the development of cancer research projects by investigators at all levels, but none of our pilot programs have specifically targeted young investigators, a group less able to compete with established investigators for such funding. Having a targeted mechanism such as the ACS IRG would provide the junior investigators with an opportunity to obtain small grants to test their ideas and position them to successfully compete for extramural peer-reviewed research awards. Pilot mechanisms for cancer research at Stony Brook, over the past two decades, have yielded a nearly 10-fold return on investment, indicating our ability to choose meritorious faculty for the awards who have strong academic potential and will have subsequent extramural funding success. \n\n      We expect to receive 15-20 pilot applications per cycle, more than enough to provide vigorous competition for the four pilot awards (annually) requested in our proposal. University-wide plans for doubling our research base over the next five years under a new President will increase the anticipated pool even more. Many of the 80-100 new faculty will be cancer-related researchers in diverse disciplines that range from basic molecular biology and clinical investigation to population-based sciences, imaging, and bioinformatics.\n\n      The mission of the SBCC is to reduce the cancer burden in Long Island through high quality care, innovative research, outstanding professional education, and statewide cancer prevention programs with a focus on reaching underserved populations. As such, the SBCC focuses on serving its catchment area to address the disproportionate cancer burden reported in specific locations and ethnic \/ racial groups in terms of incidence, mortality, morbidity, and quality of life, including in particular breast, lung, GI, and prostate cancer.

Pathologically, the disease is defined by misfolding of the protein alpha-synuclein and death of dopamine-producing neurons. This causes difficulty with movements as well as numerous other symptoms, making daily life a struggle for patients. There are no treatments that slow the progression of the disease. \n\nThe long-term goal of my research is to develop new treatments for PD by turning to cell types that have been previously overlooked. I am interested in glia, which are the brain\u2019s helper cells that support the neurons. Many PD risk genes have been identified, and the majority of these genes are expressed in glia. This suggests that glia may contribute to risk and progression of PD. The goal of this project to understand which glial genes are important in PD in order to eventually develop glial-based therapies for the disease. \n\nTo study glial genes, I use a powerful fruit fly model of PD. In this model, I can independently control gene expression in neurons and glia. In the neurons, I express human alpha-synuclein, the protein that misfolds in PD. These flies develop the key features of human PD, including motor dysfunction, alpha-synuclein accumulation in the brain, and death of dopamine-producing neurons. In the glia, I can decrease expression of any gene and then measure the effect on motor dysfunction in the flies. This allows me to identify glial genes that improve motor functioning in the fly when their expression is decreased. These genes are potential therapeutic targets for PD. The long-term goal is to inhibit them with a medication in people to see if that improves motor functioning and slows down progression of the disease. \n\nIn the first part of this proposal, I will perform a genetic screen in the fruit fly model of PD, manipulating expression of 600 genes in glia. These 600 genes have been chosen because they have human counterparts that are known to be targets of FDA-approved drugs. I have already conducted preliminary studies, successfully identifying multiple glial genes that enhance or suppress the motor dysfunction. \n\nIn the second part of this proposal, I will culture astrocytes (a type of glial cell) and dopamine-producing neurons together. The dopamine-producing neurons express excess alpha-synuclein due to a gene triplication, which causes a genetic form of PD. In the astrocytes, I will reduce expression of the glial genes identified above as well as genes I\u2019ve identified in previous work. I will determine which glial genes cause injury to dopamine-producing neurons and increase alpha-synuclein misfolding. Finally, I will also measure expression of these genes in human PD brain from autopsy samples. \n\nCollectively, these experiments will generate a list of high priority glial genes that have a demonstrated effect on PD in whole brain in the fly model as well as in human cells. In the future, these genes will be investigated in mouse models of PD and eventually in humans, moving us closer to being able to generate glial-based therapies that slow progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"DARLENE","family":"JACKSON","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/04b6nzv94","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Brigham and Women's Hospital , Inc"}]},{"given":"Tracy","family":"Batchelor","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Susan","family":"Horton","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/002pd6e78","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Massachusetts General Hospital (Mass General)"}]},{"given":"Helen","family":"Wong","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/04b6nzv94","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc."}]},{"given":"Jessel","family":"Lawson","affiliation":[]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7680-1758","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Abby","family":"Olsen","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/04b6nzv94","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc."}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":300000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2024,8,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Parkinson Disease Association","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100006309","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,16]],"date-time":"2022-02-16T18:23:05Z","timestamp":1645035785000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.147092"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.55247\/pc.gr.147092"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,4]],"date-time":"2022-04-04T11:42:59Z","timestamp":1649072579888},"publisher":"American Cancer Society","award":"RSG-21-095-01-HOPS","DOI":"10.53354\/pc.gr.151110","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]],"date-time":"2021-10-29T14:06:59Z","timestamp":1635516419000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.53354","member":"1849","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Care Inequities in Advanced Cancer &amp; Limited-English Proficiency (Resubm1)","language":"en"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Patients with advanced cancer and limited-English proficiency (LEP) are at high risk of receiving suboptimal, goal-discordant care because of cultural and language barriers. Palliative care provides a way to facilitate goal-concordant care and decrease psychological distress by supporting effective patient-family-clinician communication, but is under-utilized by patients with LEP and their families. While prior studies have focused on racial\/ethnic minorities, few studies have successfully identified targets for intervention to address barriers to high-quality, equitable palliative care at multiple levels (i.e., patient\/family, clinician, system, and community-levels) for this diverse population. Addressing this gap will be essential for the development of effective multi-level interventions to improve the quality of care for patients with cancer and LEP.\n\nThe goal of this study is to address this knowledge gap by applying a multi-level approach to identifying patient\/family, clinician, system, and community-level targets for intervention to improve the quality of palliative care for patients with advanced cancer and LEP across five LEP communities at high risk of experiencing inequities in cancer care (Latinx, Vietnamese, Somali, Cambodian, and Ethiopian). In Aim 1, we will use electronic health record data from a large health system to detect inequities in the quality of care across four palliative care domains for patients with advanced cancer and LEP who have died. In Aim 2, we will interview patients with advanced cancer and LEP and their family members, cross-cultural mediators, interpreters, clinicians, and administrators to identify specific patient\/family, clinician, and system-level barriers and facilitators to high quality palliative care. In Aim 3, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with community leaders from five LEP communities to identify resource gaps in the community and identify community-based organizations\u2019 capacity to support high quality palliative care for patients with LEP. \n\nAt the end of the study, we expect to have identified and prioritized multi-level targets for an intervention to improve the quality of palliative care for patients with advanced cancer and LEP. These results are expected to have a positive impact because they will inform the development of multi-level interventions that can be successfully implemented and adapted for patients with advanced cancer of different linguistic and cultural backgrounds, their families, clinicians, and the communities where they live. Ultimately, this work will help eliminate inequities in the delivery of high-quality, palliative care for patients with LEP and advanced cancer.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"given":"W.","family":"Liles","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00cvxb145","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Washington School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Lily","family":"Gebrenegus","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Carol","family":"Rhodes","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00cvxb145","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Washington"}]},{"given":"Vikram","family":"Jandhyala","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lyndia","family":"Brumback","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9529-845X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jared","family":"Curtis","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00cvxb145","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Washington"}]},{"given":"Ruth","family":"Engelberg","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Linda","family":"Ko","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alicia","family":"Schofield","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00cvxb145","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Washington"}]},{"given":"Elena","family":"Schroeder","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00cvxb145","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Univeristy of Washington"}]}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2050-4500","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rashmi","family":"Sharma","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00cvxb145","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Washington"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":1200000.0,"currency":null},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2026,12,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"award","funder":{"name":"American Cancer Society","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100000048","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,29]],"date-time":"2021-10-29T14:07:07Z","timestamp":1635516427000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/proposalcentral.com\/Insights\/Crossref\/PublicAwardRedirect\/pc.gr.151110"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.53354\/pc.gr.151110"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T14:12:07Z","timestamp":1659363127791},"publisher":"Wellcome","award":"075791","DOI":"10.35802\/075791","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,17]],"date-time":"2020-12-17T18:59:26Z","timestamp":1608231566000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.35802","member":"13928","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"An investigtion into reduced duration of breastfeeding as a risk factor for the development of asthma and allergic disease among children in Southern Ghana."}],"investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2270-1871","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Abena","family":"Amoah","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00a0jsq62","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine","country":"GB"}]}],"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2004,10,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2006,9,30]]},"funding":[{"type":"grant","scheme":"Population and Public Health","funder":{"name":"Wellcome Trust","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100010269","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T13:48:36Z","timestamp":1659361716000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/grantfinder\/grantdetails?query=pi:\"Amoah+AS\"+gid:\"075791\"+ga:\"Wellcome Trust\""}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,10,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.35802\/075791"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T14:12:18Z","timestamp":1659363138104},"publisher":"Wellcome","award":"084785","DOI":"10.35802\/084785","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,17]],"date-time":"2020-12-17T18:59:26Z","timestamp":1608231566000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.35802","member":"13928","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"A proof of concept Phase IIb efficacy trial to evaluate the protective efficacy of a booster MVA85A vaccination administered to BCG primed infants in the Western Cape."}],"project-description":[{"description":"MVA85A is a recombinant modified vaccina virus Ankara (MVA) expressing an immunodominant antigen (antigen 85A) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb).

The key question is whether this highly immunogenic and safe vaccine is protective, and therefore the next step is to evaluate the protective efficacy of MVA85A in a Phase IIb proof-of-concept study in South African infants.","language":"en"}],"investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2126-5142","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Helen","family":"McShane","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/052gg0110","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Oxford","country":"GB"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":4000000.0,"currency":"GBP"},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2008,1,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"grant","scheme":"Innovations","funder":{"name":"Wellcome Trust","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100010269","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T13:38:19Z","timestamp":1659361099000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/grantfinder\/grantdetails?query=pi:\"McShane+H\"+gid:\"084785\"+ga:\"Wellcome Trust\""}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,1,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.35802\/084785"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T14:12:26Z","timestamp":1659363146450},"publisher":"Wellcome","award":"080704","DOI":"10.35802\/080704","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,17]],"date-time":"2020-12-17T18:59:26Z","timestamp":1608231566000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.35802","member":"13928","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"The role of IL-17 in type I diabetes in NOD mice."}],"investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8781-336X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Brigitta","family":"Stockinger","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03x94j517","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Medical Research Council","country":"GB"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":158931.0,"currency":"GBP"},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2007,1,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2008,12,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"grant","scheme":"Immune System in Health and Disease","funder":{"name":"Wellcome Trust","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100010269","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T13:35:21Z","timestamp":1659360921000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/grantfinder\/grantdetails?query=pi:\"Stockinger+B\"+gid:\"080704\"+ga:\"Wellcome Trust\""}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,1,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.35802\/080704"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T14:12:28Z","timestamp":1659363148276},"publisher":"Wellcome","award":"217199","DOI":"10.35802\/217199","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,9]],"date-time":"2019-12-09T11:31:17Z","timestamp":1575891077000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.35802","member":"13928","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Synaptic, Cellular and Neural Circuit Dysfunction in Down Syndrome"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Down syndrome (DS) is a common genetic disorder resulting from an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21).

Because nutrients are essential for this organism, elucidating this essential element of infectious disease will help pave the way for the development of future therapeutic strategies to treat or prevent fungal infections.","language":"en"}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6617-0123","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Duncan","family":"Wilson","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/016476m91","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Aberdeen","country":"GB"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":1712381.0,"currency":"GBP"},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2024,5,1]]},"funding":[{"type":"fellowship","scheme":"Pathogen Biology and Disease Transmission","award-amount":{"amount":1712381.0,"currency":"GBP","percentage":100},"funder":{"name":"Wellcome Trust","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100010269","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T13:47:46Z","timestamp":1659361666000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/grantfinder\/grantdetails?query=pi:\"Wilson+D\"+gid:\"214317\"+ga:\"Wellcome Trust\""}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.35802\/214317"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T14:12:38Z","timestamp":1659363158371},"publisher":"Wellcome","award":"108758","DOI":"10.35802\/108758","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,18]],"date-time":"2020-09-18T17:16:19Z","timestamp":1600449379000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.35802","member":"13928","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"The continued support of the Europe PMC infrastructure."}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1611-6935","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Johanna","family":"McEntyre","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/02catss52","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"European Bioinformatics Institute","country":"GB"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":6615778.0,"currency":"GBP"},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"grant","scheme":"Cross-Remit","award-amount":{"amount":2199999.8,"currency":"GBP","percentage":33},"funder":{"name":"Wellcome Trust","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100010269","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T13:45:16Z","timestamp":1659361516000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/grantfinder\/grantdetails?query=pi:\"McEntyre+J\"+gid:\"108758\"+ga:\"Wellcome Trust\""}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.35802\/108758"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T14:12:39Z","timestamp":1659363159637},"publisher":"Wellcome","award":"077578","DOI":"10.35802\/077578","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,17]],"date-time":"2020-12-17T18:59:26Z","timestamp":1608231566000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.35802","member":"13928","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Chaperone requirements for ER folding and exit of GPI and trans-membrane anchored proteins."}],"investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4866-2885","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mark","family":"Field","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/013meh722","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"University of Cambridge","country":"GB"}]}],"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2005,12,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2008,11,30]]},"funding":[{"type":"grant","scheme":"Immune System in Health and Disease","funder":{"name":"Wellcome Trust","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100010269","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T13:50:22Z","timestamp":1659361822000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/grantfinder\/grantdetails?query=pi:\"Field+MC\"+gid:\"077578\"+ga:\"Wellcome Trust\""}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,12,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.35802\/077578"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T14:11:57Z","timestamp":1659363117168},"publisher":"Wellcome","award":"218261","DOI":"10.35802\/218261","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,9]],"date-time":"2019-12-09T11:31:17Z","timestamp":1575891077000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.35802","member":"13928","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Improving scientific and public health decision making by developing technologies to increase use of robust methods to calibrate and analyse complex mathematical models"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Complex mathematical models are increasingly being used for research and decision making in academia, health and industry.

How these different cell types are generated and how they assemble into diverse circuits remain largely unknown. Recent studies, using single-cell transcriptomics, reveal an unprecedented diversity in neuronal progenitors, and identify putative cell fates in newly-born neurons, before the appearance of clear morphological and physiological features. Surprisingly, we found that metabolic genes are among the most differentially expressed transcripts in distinct classes of interneuron progenitors, suggesting that changes in metabolic states may contribute to cell diversity. Additionally, we identified a group of genes that mark subtypes of inhibitory interneurons before these cells acquire their mature characteristics. Building on these findings, my future research programme aims to understand how specific metabolic states in individual progenitors shape cellular diversity in the neocortex.

This work will help design novel cell reprogramming and replacement strategies to treat brain disorders.","language":"en"}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4179-8373","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lynette","family":"Lim","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0220mzb33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"King's College London","country":"GB"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":1630467.0,"currency":"GBP"},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,3]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,2]]},"funding":[{"type":"fellowship","scheme":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","award-amount":{"amount":1630467.0,"currency":"GBP","percentage":100},"funder":{"name":"Wellcome Trust","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100010269","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T13:47:49Z","timestamp":1659361669000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/grantfinder\/grantdetails?query=pi:\"Lim+L\"+gid:\"215429\"+ga:\"Wellcome Trust\""}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,3]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.35802\/215429"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T14:12:58Z","timestamp":1659363178514},"publisher":"Wellcome","award":"073542","DOI":"10.35802\/073542","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,17]],"date-time":"2020-12-17T18:59:26Z","timestamp":1608231566000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.35802","member":"13928","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"The transport of anti-trypanosomal drugs into the murine central nervous system in health and disease."}],"investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0053-0154","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sarah","family":"Thomas","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0220mzb33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"King's College London","country":"GB"}]}],"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2005,4,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2010,3,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"grant","scheme":"Neuroscience and Mental Health","funder":{"name":"Wellcome Trust","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100010269","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T13:45:58Z","timestamp":1659361558000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/grantfinder\/grantdetails?query=pi:\"Thomas+SA\"+gid:\"073542\"+ga:\"Wellcome Trust\""}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,4,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.35802\/073542"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T14:12:58Z","timestamp":1659363178542},"publisher":"Wellcome","award":"091501","DOI":"10.35802\/091501","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,17]],"date-time":"2020-12-17T18:56:13Z","timestamp":1608231373000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.35802","member":"13928","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Optimising transcriptome subtraction technology to identify complicating infections in human hepatitis."}],"project-description":[{"description":"Our objective is to identify novel causes of infectious hepatitis and their prevalence in cohorts from acute jaundice and liver transplantation clinics.

Unfortunately, insecticide resistance threatens these tools. Worryingly, an escalation of resistance in Anopheles funestus, major malaria vector, is inducing an extensive loss of efficacy of all pyrethroid-LLINs including the newly introduced PBO-pyrethroid nets. If such super-resistance spreads Africa-wide, insecticide-based interventions could be compromised with catastrophic consequences. This super-resistance is likely driven by a dramatic increase in metabolic resistance and\/or the development of a reduced penetration in super-resistant mosquitoes allowing them to now survive exposure to even PBO-pyrethroid nets and potentially conferring cross-resistance to other insecticide classes. Unfortunately, the molecular drivers of this super-resistance remain unknown preventing the design of diagnostic assays to track it and assess its impact on malaria control. Therefore, to help mitigate the impact of super-resistance, I will pursue the following aims: Aim 1: detecting molecular markers of the increased metabolic resistance driving the resistance escalation to insecticides in An. funestus; Aim 2: detecting genetic variants of the reduced penetration mechanism contributing to super-resistance, cross-resistance and design DNA-based assays to track it; Aim 3: establishing the impact of the escalation of resistance on the effectiveness of insecticide-based interventions and malaria transmission using molecular markers.","language":"en"},{"description":"Malaria prevention relies extensively on mosquito control using insecticides. However, insecticide resistance in major transmitting-mosquitoes threatens malaria control in Africa. Worryingly, recent evidences show that resistance is getting worse leading to extensive loss of protection from most bed nets.

The possibility that super-resistance is caused by mosquitoes producing greater amount of enzymes able to breakdown insecticides faster and\/or more efficiently will be investigated and DNA markers associated with this trait identified. Evidence that mosquitoes are hardening their body armor (cuticle) to reduce insecticide uptake will be investigated and tools designed to track such super-resistance. Furthermore, this project will establish the extent to which this super-resistance is reducing the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets and thereby contributing to the increase in malaria cases being reported in Africa.","language":"en"}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0791-3673","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Charles","family":"Wondji","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03svjbs84","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine","country":"GB"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":2262630.0,"currency":"GBP"},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2024,8,31]]},"funding":[{"type":"fellowship","scheme":"Pathogen Biology and Disease Transmission","award-amount":{"amount":2262630.0,"currency":"GBP","percentage":100},"funder":{"name":"Wellcome Trust","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100010269","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T13:48:30Z","timestamp":1659361710000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/grantfinder\/grantdetails?query=pi:\"Wondji+C\"+gid:\"217188\"+ga:\"Wellcome Trust\""}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.35802\/217188"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T14:13:00Z","timestamp":1659363180638},"publisher":"Wellcome","award":"215898","DOI":"10.35802\/215898","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,9]],"date-time":"2019-12-09T11:31:17Z","timestamp":1575891077000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.35802","member":"13928","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"Entervax: Clinical Evaluation of a Bivalent Typhoid-Paratyphoid Enteric Fever Vaccine"}],"project-description":[{"description":"Prokarium\u2019s vision is a world where many different recombinant protein vaccines are delivered orally at reduced cost to improve uptake and prevent illness in populations across the globe.

This CPoC is instrumental in broadening Vaxonella\u2019s use through the future partnering with other vaccine developers wanting to apply our technologies. In a more connected world, with accelerating urbanization putting a strain on sanitation and empiric use of antibiotics leading to multi-drug resistant pathogens, chances for epidemics and pandemics are growing at an exponential rate. There is talk of a post-antibiotic era within our lifetimes and when we reach this, rapid deployment of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines will be paramount.

Paratyphi A (hereafter SPA). ZH9 was evaluated in ten clinical studies up to Phase 2 and dosed in a total of 351 adults including 101 children. The typhoid studies evaluated measures of immunogenicity that have been associated with protection against typhoid fever, which were serum antibody and secretory antibody responses against S. Typhi LPS O-antigen via enumeration of gut-derived antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). Anti-LPS IgG responses of up to 92% of volunteers were seen when vaccinated with ZH9 compared to a maximum of 64% for the licensed live attenuated typhoid vaccine Ty21a (Vivotif), and anti-LPS IgA responses were 83-100% in the ZH9 vaccine. IgG responses were also significantly higher than those for Ty21a. Additionally, in one study that enrolled children aged 5-14 years in Vietnam, 97% of the subjects developed a positive immune response in either the S. Typhi LPS specific serum IgG or IgA ELISA. These studies indicate that Prokarium\u2019s proprietary aroC plus ssaV mutations are effective at attenuating Salmonella for live vaccine applications. The proposed Phase 1 trial will be enrolling volunteers in the second half of 2019 and consist of a dose escalation of SPA followed by the combination of ZH9+SPA. The primary goal is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the ZH9+SPA vaccine. Secondary goals include the evaluation of immune responses against key antigens.","language":"en"}],"lead-investigator":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0521-7183","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kristen","family":"Albright","affiliation":[{"name":"Prokarium","country":"GB"}]}],"award-amount":{"amount":4592577.0,"currency":"GBP"},"award-start":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,1]]},"award-end":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,30]]},"funding":[{"type":"grant","scheme":"Innovations","award-amount":{"amount":4592577.0,"currency":"GBP","percentage":100},"funder":{"name":"Wellcome Trust","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/100010269","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}}]}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T13:48:05Z","timestamp":1659361685000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/grantfinder\/grantdetails?query=pi:\"Albright+K\"+gid:\"215898\"+ga:\"Wellcome Trust\""}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,1]]},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.35802\/215898"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,1]],"date-time":"2022-08-01T14:13:00Z","timestamp":1659363180819},"publisher":"Wellcome","award":"085541","DOI":"10.35802\/085541","type":"grant","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,17]],"date-time":"2020-12-17T18:59:26Z","timestamp":1608231566000},"source":"Crossref","prefix":"10.35802","member":"13928","project":[{"project-title":[{"title":"The role of maternal and offspring metabolic and anthropometric gene variants in fetal and childhood growth."}],"project-description":[{"description":"The roles of the intra-uterine environment, maternal genetics and offspring genetics in fetal and childhood growth are poorly understood.
