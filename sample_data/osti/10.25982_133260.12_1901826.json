    "description": "Arthrobactor is a bacteria that commonly resides in soil, plants, and wastewater (Gobbetti 2014). It is commonly used in the agricultural industry for degrading pesticides which will detox the soil and allow wildlife not to be harmed by said pesticides. The sample that is being tested came from an acid drain from a mine. The test sample was able to live and thrive in a metal ridden environment which could lead it to having some genes that could aid in e-waste recycling. A species of arthrobacter known as Arthrobacter citreus can be used for polyamide waste (Baxi 2019). Polyamide is used in fishing nets and industrial applications and the waste generated by this impacts ocean environments and ecosystems (Rietzler et all... 2021). Based on the resilience of arthrobacter as a genus, the hopes for this sample to aid in e-waste recycling are high.",
