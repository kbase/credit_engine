    "description": "Roseimicrobium sp. strain ORNL1 is a soil bacterium that belongs to the phylum Verrucomicrobia and was isolated from the rhizosphere of a forest Eastern cottonwood tree, Populus deltoides, in Tennessee. Its 7.9-Mb chromosome was completely sequenced using PacBio long reads and is predicted to encode 6,288 proteins and 76 RNAs.",
