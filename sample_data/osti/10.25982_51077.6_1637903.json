    "description": "<p>This Narrative is part of a collection used in a single publication. The paper took a metagnomic and metatranscriptomic approach to examine a bioreactor's response to the presence of sulfate, which reduces the production of methane, a valuable product, while producing hydrogen sulfide, a corrosive contaminant. </p><p> This Narrative collection has been created to highlight the types of analyses done for this publication. They are as follows (in order): </p><ul> <li>SJ1 Metagenomes: a metagenomic analysis of sample SJ1, the initial bioreactor. </li><li>SJ1 Metatranscriptomes: QC-filtered raw RNA reads were aligned to individual MAGs and assembled into transcripts. </li><li>Metagenome-discovered food webs in a long-term methanogenic bioreactor and rapid switch to sulfate reducing conditions (this Narrative): the public Narrative referenced in the paper, which contains several key MAGs.</li></ul>",
