    "description": "The reconstruction of bacterial and archaeal genomes from shotgun metagenomes has enabled unprecedented insights into the ecology and evolution of environmental and host-associated microbiomes. Here we applied this powerful approach to over 10,000 metagenomes collected from diverse habitats covering all of Earth\u2019s continents and oceans, human- and animal-host associated microbiomes, engineered environments, and natural and agricultural soils to capture extant microbial metabolic and functional potential. We present a comprehensive catalogue of 52,515 metagenome-assembled genomes representing 12,556 novel candidate species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), spanning 135 phyla, which expand the known phylogenetic diversity of Bacteria and Archaea by 44%. We also demonstrate the utility of this collection for secondary metabolite biosynthetic potential and predicting host-virus linkage, which can provide a view into the global distribution of lysogenic viruses. This resource underscores the value of leveraging genome-centric approaches to reveal genomic properties of uncultivated microbes that impact on ecosystem processes.",
