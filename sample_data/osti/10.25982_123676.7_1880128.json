    "description": "Species of Cupriavidus are among the best bioplastic producing microorganisms known, though intracellular poly-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is made exclusively during unbalanced growth (e.g. nitrogen limitation), a state characterized by poor growth and cellular stress. Much work has been done studying bioplastic production in the model/type strain C. necator H16. We use an RB-TnSeq library of the closely related C. basilensis 4G11 to assess for genes which decouple PHB production from growth state. In this narrative we compute genome-wide protein homology between these two organisms, and generate a synteny plot across the genomes as well.",
