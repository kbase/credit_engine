    "description": "Overview of Dataset<br>This narrative contains assemblies for all Paraburkholderia discussed in Karasz et al. 2022, where their phosphate-solubilizing activity was measured. Assemblies were downloaded from NCBI and annotated with Prokka. These genomes were created in many Narratives and collected here to be more accessible  Note: The following naming of assemblies does not correspond with current taxonomic names for the following:  Paraburkholderia 5N = Paraburkholderia elongata 5NT  <br>Paraburkholderia 1N = Paraburkholderia solitsuga 1NT  <br>Paraburkholderia vancouverensis = Paraburkholderia madseniana RL16",
