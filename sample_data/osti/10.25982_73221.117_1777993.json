    "description": "This narrative was used for the 3-member community modeling using R2A medium for the bacteria isolated from Populus deltoides (PD). 10 bacteiral strains isolated from PD were co-cultured as a synthetic microbial community in R2A complex medium. After 15 passages, there were 3 members survived in R2A medium.\r\n\r\nThe genome of each community member was sequenced and uploaded into KBase for genome annotation and metabolic modeling. To simulate the metabolic interactions among the finally surviving community members, the individual metabolic models of each strain were merged into a compartmentalized community model, and then the community model was gapfilled using R2A medium. The FBA modeling was performed and the metabolites exchange among community members was proposed.\r\n\r\nThe publication by Jia Wang, Dana L. Carper, Leah H.
