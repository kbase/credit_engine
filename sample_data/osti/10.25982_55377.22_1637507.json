    "description": "Starkeya sp. strain ORNL1 is an alphaproteobacterium isolated from the rhizosphere of an Eastern cottonwood tree. Starkeya spp. are physiologically versatile, using a wide range of nutritional and energetic resources and serving important ecological roles in carbon and sulfur cycling. The 6.3-Mb chromosome of Starkeya sp. strain ORNL1 was completely sequenced and will help in understanding nutrient cycles.",
