    "description": "Several SFAs were selected for training on the KBase Software Development Kit (SDK) to integrate tools and data into the KBase platform. Overall, the collaborative effort was viewed as highly successful. Every SFA project was able to achieve their proposed targets for training and functionality, while also gaining an appreciation for the role KBase plays/could play in their future science plans. Both the SFA and KBase teams felt that continued collaboration would be beneficial, especially if the programs were able to jointly prioritize scope and readiness of future projects. This poster will outline the scope of functionality added by SFA community developers, and highlight points of intersection across these efforts.",
